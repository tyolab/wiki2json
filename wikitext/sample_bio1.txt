==Early life and education==
Namajunas was born in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] on {{birth date|1992|6|29}}, to [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] parents who had moved to the United States in September 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sherdog.com|title=By The Numbers: Weili Zhang vs. Rose Namajunas|url=https://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/By-The-Numbers-Weili-Zhang-vs-Rose-Namajunas-178861|access-date=2021-04-26|website=Sherdog}}</ref> She was named Rose ({{lang-lt|Rožė}}) in honor of her great-grandmother Rožė Gotšalkaitė Namajūnienė, whose husband Juozas was an [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Independent Lithuania]] military officer. He enlisted in the Lithuanian military in 1933, and was promoted to lieutenant in 1936. During the [[Soviet invasion of Lithuania]] in 1939, he fought in the resistance. After the Soviets occupied the country, Juozas was forced to enlist in the [[Red Army]]. Following the [[Operation Barbarossa|German declaration of war on the Soviet Union]] and the subsequent Soviet retreat from the Baltic states, Juozas left the Red Army and retired to civilian life. When the Soviets re-occupied Lithuania, Juozas was arrested by the [[NKVD]] and sent to a prison camp. He was killed by Soviet [[KGB]] agents near his home in 1968.<ref>|url=https://alkas.lt/2017/11/16/r-cerskus-cempione-rozyte-namajunaite-ir-jos-tikroji-kilme-video/</ref> Namajunas's grandfather Algimantas Andriukonis was a successful wrestler, and won national championships in [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]] and competitions in the USSR.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-11-08|title=Lietuviškoje aplinkoje augusi UFC superžvaigždė Namajunas: man labai svarbu būti lietuve, jaučiu didelę atsakomybę|url=https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/sportas/10/1270042/lietuviskoje-aplinkoje-augusi-ufc-superzvaigzde-namajunas-man-labai-svarbu-buti-lietuve-jauciu-didele-atsakomybe|access-date=2021-04-26|website=lrt.lt|language=lt}}</ref><ref>|url=https://www.lrt.lt/naujienos/sportas/10/1302064/netektis-kovotojos-rose-namajunas-seimoje-uzgeso-lietuvoje-gyvenusio-senelio-gyvybe</ref> Namajunas regularly visits Lithuania and communicates in the [[Lithuanian language]] with her grandparents.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rimkus |first1=Kęstas |title=Kovų superžvaigždė Rožė Namajunas vaikšto po Kauną: "Geriausia vieta – močiutės sodas" |url=https://www.15min.lt/sportas/naujiena/kovinis-sportas/kovu-superzvaigzde-roze-namajunas-vaiksto-po-kauna-geriausia-vieta-mociutes-sodas-864-1187406 |website=[[15min.lt]] |access-date=12 August 2019 |language=lt}}</ref>

Her mother worked a lot and her brother was only rarely home. Her neighborhood friends nicknamed her "Thug Rose", due to the fact that she was the only white girl among them and was the smallest, yet she was the toughest one in their friend group. Namajunas has mentioned being a victim of [[child sexual abuse]], while emphasizing that she does not want to speak about specific details.<ref>https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/26709192/comfort-chaos-how-rose-namajunas-found-peace-octagon</ref> She graduated from [[Milwaukee High School of the Arts]], where she was an accomplished cross-country runner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/26709192/comfort-chaos-how-rose-namajunas-found-peace-octagon%3f|title = Comfort in chaos: How Rose Namajunas found peace in the Octagon|date = May 9, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://eu.jsonline.com/amp/1015011001</ref>
