Most of mathematical activity consists of discovering and proving (by pure reasoning) properties of [[mathematical object|abstract objects]]. These objects are either [[abstraction]]s from nature (such as a [[natural number]] and a [[line (mathematics)|line]]), or (in modern mathematics) abstract entities that are defined by their basic properties, called [[axiom]]s. A [[proof (mathematics)|proof]] consists of a succession of applications of some deducing rules to already known results, including axioms and (in case of abstraction from nature) some basic properties that are considered as true starting points. The result of a proof is called a [[theorem]]. Contrarily to [[physical law]]s, the validity of a theorem (its truth) does not rely on any [[experimentation]], but only on the correctness of the reasoning (however, experimentation is often useful for discovering theorems of interest).

Mathematics is widely used in [[science]],  for [[Mathematical model|modeling]] phenomena. This allows extracting quantitative predictions from experimental laws. For example, the movement of planets can be predicted with high accuracy using [[Newton's law of gravitation]] combined with mathematical computation. The independence of mathematical truth from any experimentation implies that the accuracy of such predictions depends only on the adequacy of the model for describing the reality. So, when some inaccurate predictions arise, this means that the model must be improved or changed, not that mathematics is wrong. For example, the [[perihelion precession of Mercury]] cannot be explained by Newton's law of gravitation, but is accurately explained by [[Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]]. This experimental validation of Einstein's theory showed that Newton's law of gravitation is only an approximation (very accurate in everyday life). 

Mathematics is therefore essential in many fields, including [[natural science]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[finance]], [[computer science]] and [[social sciences]].
Some areas of mathematics, such as [[statistics]] and [[game theory]], are developed in a direct relation with their applications, and are often grouped under the name of [[applied mathematics]]. Other mathematical areas were developed independently from any application ([[pure mathematics]]), but practical applications are often discovered later.{{sfn|Peterson|2001|p=12}}<ref name=wigner1960 /> A fitting example is the problem of [[integer factorization]] which goes back to [[Euclid]] and had no practical application before its use in the [[RSA cryptosystem]] for the security of [[computer communication]]s.

Mathematics has been a human activity from as far back as [[History of Mathematics|written records]] exist. However, the concept of a proof, and the associated [[mathematical rigour]] first appeared in [[Greek mathematics]], most notably in [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT668/EMAT6680.F99/Wise/essay7/essay7.htm|title=Eudoxus' Influence on Euclid's Elements with a close look at The Method of Exhaustion|last=Wise|first=David|website=jwilson.coe.uga.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601004355/http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/emt668/EMAT6680.F99/Wise/essay7/essay7.htm|archive-date=June 1, 2019|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref> Mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the [[Renaissance]], when algebra and [[infinitesimal calculus]] were added to arithmetic and geometry as main areas of mathematics. Since then the interaction between mathematical innovations and [[timeline of scientific discoveries|scientific discoveries]] have led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discoveries. At the end of the 19th century, the [[foundational crisis of mathematics]] led to the systematization of the [[axiomatic method]]. This, in turn, gave rise to a dramatic increase in the number of mathematics areas and their fields of applications; a witness of this is the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]], which lists more than sixty first-level areas of mathematics.

{{TOC limit|3}}
==Areas of mathematics==
{{see also|Areas of mathematics|Glossary of areas of mathematics}}
[[File:Abacus 6.png|right|thumb|The [[abacus]] is a simple calculating tool used since ancient times.]]
Before the [[Renaissance]], mathematics was divided into two main areas, [[arithmetic]], devoted to the manipulation of [[number]]s, and [[geometry]], devoted to the study of shapes. There was also some [[pseudo-science]], such as [[numerology]] and [[astrology]] that were not clearly distinguished from mathematics.

Around the Renaissance, two new main areas appeared. The introduction of [[mathematical notation]] led to [[algebra]], which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of [[formula]]s. [[Calculus]], a shorthand of ''infinitesimal calculus'' and ''integral calculus'', is the study of [[continuous functions]], which model the change of, and the relationship between varying quantities ([[variable (mathematics)|variables]]). This division into four main areas remained valid until the end of the 19th century, although some areas, such as [[celestial mechanics]] and [[solid mechanics]], which were often considered as mathematics, are now considered as belonging to [[physics]]. Also, some subjects developed during this period predate mathematics areas, such as [[probability theory]] and [[combinatorics]], which only later became regarded as autonomous disciplines of their own.

At the end of the 19th century, the [[foundational crisis in mathematics]] and the resulting systematization of the [[axiomatic method]] led to an explosion of the number of areas of mathematics. The [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] comprises more than 60 first-level areas. Some of these areas correspond to the older division in four main areas. This is the case of 11:[[number theory]] (the modern name for [[higher arithmetic]]) and 51:[[Geometry]]. However, there are several other first-level areas that have "geometry" in their name or are commonly considered as belonging to geometry. [[Algebra]] and [[calculus]] do not appear as first-level areas, but are each split into several first-level areas. Other first-level areas did not exist at all before the 20th century (for example 18:[[Category theory]]; [[homological algebra]], and 68:[[computer science]]) or were not considered before as mathematics, such as 03:[[Mathematical logic]] and [[foundations of mathematics|foundations]] (including [[model theory]], [[computability theory]], [[set theory]], [[proof theory]], and [[algebraic logic]]).

===Number theory===
{{Main|Number theory}}
Number theory started with the manipulation of [[number]]s, that is, [[natural number]]s
<math>(\mathbb{N}),</math> later expanded to [[integer]]s <math>(\Z)</math> and [[rational number]]s <math>(\Q).</math> Number theory was formerly called [[arithmetic]], but nowadays this term is mostly used for the methods of calculation with numbers.

A specificity of number theory is that many problems that can be stated very elementarily are very difficult, and, when solved, have a solution that require very sophisticated methods coming from various parts of mathematics. A notable example is [[Fermat's Last theorem]] that was stated in 1637 by [[Pierre de Fermat]] and [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|proved]] only in 1994 by [[Andrew Wiles]], using, among other tools, [[algebraic geometry]] (more specifically [[scheme theory]]), [[category theory]] and [[homological algebra]]). Another example is [[Goldbach's conjecture]], that asserts that every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two [[prime number]]s. Stated in 1742 by [[Christian Goldbach]] it remains unproven despite considerable effort.

In view of the diversity of the studied problems and the solving methods, number theory is presently split in several subareas, which include [[analytic number theory]], [[algebraic number theory]], [[geometry of numbers]] (method oriented), [[Diophantine equation]]s and [[transcendence theory]] (problem oriented).

===Geometry===
{{Main|Geometry}}

Geometry is, with [[arithmetic]], one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It started with empirical standards concerning shapes, such as [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[angle]]s and [[circle]]s, which were developed mainly for the need of [[surveying]] and [[architecture]]. 

A fundamental innovation was the elaboration by [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]] of [[mathematical|proofs]]: it is not sufficient to verify by measurement that, says, two lengths are equal. Such a property must be ''proved'' by abstract reasoning from previously proved results ([[theorem]]s) and basic properties that are either considered as self-evident because they are too basic for being the subject of a proof ([[postulate]]s). This principle, which is foundational for all mathematics, was elaborated for geometry, and was systematized by [[Euclid]] around 300 BC in ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. 

The resulting [[Euclidean geometry]] is the study of shapes and their arrangements [[straightedge and compass construction|constructed]] from [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[plane (geometry)|planes]] and [[circle]]s in the [[Euclidean plane]] ([[plane geometry]]) and the (three-dimensional) [[Euclidean space]].{{efn|This includes [[conic section]]s, which are intersections of [[circular cylinder]]s and planes.}} 

Euclidean geometry was developed without change of methods or scope until the 17th century, when [[René Descartes]] introduced what is now called [[Cartesian coordinates]]. This is a major change of paradigm, since instead of defining [[real number]]s as lengths of [[line segments]] (see [[number line]]), it allows representing points by numbers (their coordinates), and to use [[algebra]] and, later [[calculus]] for solving geometrical problems. This split geometry in two parts that differ only by their methods, the [[synthetic geometry]] which uses purely geometrical methods, and [[analytic geometry]] that uses coordinates systemically.

Analytic geometry allows the study of new shapes, in particular [[curve]]s that are not  related to circles and lines; these curves are defined either as [[graph of a function|graph of functions]], whose study led to [[differential geometry]], or by [[implicit equation]]s, often [[polynomial equation]]s, which led to [[algebraic geometry]]. Analytic geometry allows also considering easily [[Euclidean space|spaces]] of dimension higher than three (it suffices to consider more than three coordinates), which are no more a model of the physical world. 

Geometry expanded quickly during the 19th century. A major event was the discovery (in the second halve of the 19th century) of [[non-Euclidean geometries]], which are geometries where the [[parallel postulate]] is wrong. This is, with [[Russel's paradox]], one of the starting points of the [[foundational crisis of mathematics]], by asking the question of the meaning of the ''truth'' of this postulate. This aspect of the crisis was solved by systematizing the [[axiomatic method]], and considering that the truth of the chosen axioms is not a mathematical question. In turn, the axiomatic method allows studying various geometries obtained either by changing the axioms or by considering properties that are invariant under specific transformation of the [[space (mathematics)|space]]. It results a number of subareas and generalizations of geometry that include:
*[[Projective geometry]], introduced in the 16th by [[Girard Desargues]], it extends Euclidean geometry by adding [[points at infinity]] at which [[parallel lines]] intersect. This simplifies many aspects of classical geometry by avoiding to have a different treatment for intersecting and parallel lines.
*[[Affine geometry]], the study of properties relative to [[parallelism]] and independent from the concept of length.
*[[Differential geometry]], the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined with [[differentiable function]]s
*[[Manifold theory]], the study of shapes that are not necessarily embedded in a larger space
*[[Riemannian geometry]], the study distance properties in curved spaces
*[[Algebraic geometry]], the study of curves, surfaces ,and their generalizations, which are defined with [[polynomial]]s
*[[Topology]], the study of properties that are kept under [[continuous deformation]]s
**[[Algebraic topology]], the use in topology of algebraic methods, mainly [[homological algebra]] 
*[[Discrete geometry]], the study of finite configurations in geometry
*[[Convex geometry]], the study of [[convex set]]s, which takes its importance from its applications to [[convex optimization|optimization]]
*[[Complex geometry]], the geometry obtained by replacing real numbers with [[complex number]]s

===Foundations and philosophy===
In order to clarify the [[foundations of mathematics]], the fields of [[mathematical logic]] and [[set theory]] were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of [[logic]] and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies [[set (mathematics)|sets]] or collections of objects. The phrase "crisis of foundations" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.<ref>Luke Howard Hodgkin & Luke Hodgkin, ''A History of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> Some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day. The crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time, including the [[controversy over Cantor's theory|controversy over Cantor's set theory]] and the [[Brouwer–Hilbert controversy]].

Mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous [[axiom]]atic framework, and studying the implications of such a framework. As such, it is home to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] which (informally) imply that any effective [[formal system]] that contains basic arithmetic, if ''sound'' (meaning that all theorems that can be proved are true), is necessarily ''incomplete'' (meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved ''in that system''). Whatever finite collection of number-theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation, Gödel showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number-theoretical fact, but which does not follow from those axioms. Therefore, no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory. Modern logic is divided into [[recursion theory]], [[model theory]], and [[proof theory]], and is closely linked to [[theoretical computer science]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Halpern |first1=Joseph |last2=Harper |first2=Robert |last3=Immerman |first3=Neil |last4=Kolaitis |first4=Phokion |last5=Vardi |first5=Moshe |last6=Vianu |first6=Victor |title=On the Unusual Effectiveness of Logic in Computer Science |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/papers/unreasonable/basl.pdf |access-date=15 January 2021 |date=2001}}</ref> as well as to [[category theory]]. In the context of recursion theory, the impossibility of a full axiomatization of number theory can also be formally demonstrated as a [[MRDP theorem#Further applications|consequence of the MRDP theorem]].

[[Theoretical computer science]] includes [[computability theory (computation)|computability theory]], [[computational complexity theory]], and [[information theory]]. Computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer, including the most well-known model—the [[Turing machine]]. Complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer; some problems, although theoretically solvable by computer, are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible, even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware. A famous problem is the "[[P = NP problem|{{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} '''NP'''?}}]]" problem, one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070811193730/http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/ Clay Mathematics Institute], P=NP, claymath.org</ref> Finally, information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium, and hence deals with concepts such as [[data compression|compression]] and [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].

====Structure====
{{Main|Algebra}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
Many [[mathematical objects]], such as [[set (mathematics)|sets]] of numbers and [[function (mathematics)|functions]], exhibit internal structure as a consequence of [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] or [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance [[number theory]] studies properties of the set of [[integer]]s that can be expressed in terms of [[arithmetic]] operations. Moreover, it frequently happens that different such structured sets (or [[mathematical structure|structures]]) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of [[abstraction]], to state [[axiom]]s for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of [[abstract algebra]].

By its great generality, abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems; for instance a number of ancient problems concerning [[compass and straightedge constructions]] were finally solved using [[Galois theory]], which involves field theory and group theory. Another example of an algebraic theory is [[linear algebra]], which is the general study of [[vector space]]s, whose elements called [[vector (geometric)|vectors]] have both quantity and direction, and can be used to model (relations between) points in space. This is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of [[geometry]] and [[algebra]] have very strong interactions in modern mathematics. [[Combinatorics]] studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure.

====Change====
{{Main|Calculus|Mathematical analysis}}
<!--This section is linked from [[List of basic mathematics topics]]-->
Understanding and describing change is a common theme in the [[natural science]]s, and [[calculus]] was developed as a tool to investigate it. [[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] arise here as a central concept describing a changing quantity. The rigorous study of [[real number]]s and functions of a real variable is known as [[real analysis]], with [[complex analysis]] the equivalent field for the [[complex number]]s. [[Functional analysis]] focuses attention on (typically infinite-dimensional) [[Space#Mathematics|spaces]] of functions. One of many applications of functional analysis is [[quantum mechanics]]. Many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change, and these are studied as [[differential equation]]s. Many phenomena in nature can be described by [[dynamical system]]s; [[chaos theory]] makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still [[deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] behavior.

===Applied mathematics===
{{Main|Applied mathematics}}
[[Applied mathematics]] concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science, [[engineering]], [[business]], and [[Industry (manufacturing)|industry]]. Thus, "applied mathematics" is a [[mathematical science]] with specialized [[knowledge]]. The term ''applied mathematics'' also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems; as a profession focused on practical problems, ''applied mathematics'' focuses on the "formulation, study, and use of mathematical models" in science, engineering, and other areas of mathematical practice.

In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics, where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake. Thus, the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in [[pure mathematics]].

====Statistics and other decision sciences====
{{Main|Statistics}}
Applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics, whose theory is formulated mathematically, especially with [[probability theory]]. Statisticians (working as part of a research project) "create data that makes sense" with [[random sampling]] and with randomized [[design of experiments|experiments]];<ref>[[C.R. Rao|Rao, C.R.]] (1997) ''Statistics and Truth: Putting Chance to Work'', World Scientific. {{isbn|978-981-02-3111-8}}</ref> the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data (before the data becomes available). When reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from [[observational study|observational studies]], statisticians "make sense of the data" using the art of [[statistical model|modelling]] and the theory of [[statistical inference|inference]]—with [[model selection]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]]; the estimated models and consequential [[Scientific method#Predictions from the hypothesis|predictions]] should be [[statistical hypothesis testing|tested]] on [[Scientific method#Evaluation and improvement|new data]].{{efn|Like other mathematical sciences such as [[physics]] and [[computer science]], statistics is an autonomous discipline rather than a branch of applied mathematics. Like research physicists and computer scientists, research statisticians are mathematical scientists. Many statisticians have a degree in mathematics, and some statisticians are also mathematicians.}}

[[Statistical theory]] studies [[statistical decision theory|decision problems]] such as minimizing the [[risk]] ([[expected loss]]) of a statistical action, such as using a [[statistical method|procedure]] in, for example, [[parameter estimation]], [[hypothesis testing]], and [[selection algorithm|selecting the best]]. In these traditional areas of [[mathematical statistics]], a statistical-decision problem is formulated by minimizing an [[objective function]], like expected loss or [[cost]], under specific constraints: For example, designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence.<ref name="RaoOpt">{{cite book |editor1-last=Arthanari |editor1-first=T.S. |editor2-last=Dodge |editor2-first=Yadolah |editor2-link=Yadolah Dodge |last=Rao |first=C.R. |author-link=C.R.

====Computational mathematics====
[[Computational mathematics]] proposes and studies methods for solving [[mathematical problem]]s that are typically too large for human numerical capacity. [[Numerical analysis]] studies methods for problems in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]] using [[functional analysis]] and [[approximation theory]]; numerical analysis includes the study of [[approximation]] and [[discretization|discretisation]] broadly with special concern for [[rounding error]]s. Numerical analysis and, more broadly, scientific computing also study non-analytic topics of mathematical science, especially [[algorithm]]ic [[numerical linear algebra|matrix]] and [[graph theory]]. Other areas of computational mathematics include [[computer algebra]] and [[symbolic computation]].

==History==
{{main|History of mathematics}}
The history of mathematics can be seen as an ever-increasing series of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstractions]]. The first abstraction, which is shared by many animals,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Abstract representations of numbers in the animal and human brain |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=21 |issue=8 |date=Aug 1998 |pages=355–61 |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(98)01263-6 |pmid=9720604 |last1=Dehaene |first1=Stanislas |last2=Dehaene-Lambertz |first2=Ghislaine |last3=Cohen |first3=Laurent|s2cid=17414557 }}</ref> was probably that of numbers: the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges (for example) have something in common, namely the quantity of their members.

As evidenced by [[tally sticks|tallies]] found on bone, in addition to recognizing how to [[counting|count]] physical objects, [[prehistoric]] peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities, like time—days, seasons, or years.<ref>See, for example, Raymond L.

Evidence for more complex mathematics does not appear until around 3000&nbsp;{{Abbr|BC|Before Christ}}, when the [[Babylonia]]ns and Egyptians began using [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], and [[geometry]] for taxation and other financial calculations, for building and construction, and for [[astronomy]].{{sfn|Kline|1990|loc=Chapter 1}} The oldest mathematical texts from [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] are from 2000 to 1800&nbsp;BC. Many early texts mention [[Pythagorean triple]]s and so, by inference, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry. It is in [[Babylonian mathematics]] that [[elementary arithmetic]] ([[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[division (mathematics)|division]]) first appear in the archaeological record. The Babylonians also possessed a place-value system and used a [[sexagesimal]] numeral system which is still in use today for measuring angles and time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Mesopotamia" pp. 24–27}}
[[File:Archimedes pi.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]] to approximate the value of [[pi]].]]
Beginning in the 6th century BC with the [[Pythagoreans]], with [[Greek mathematics]] the [[Ancient Greeks]] began a systematic study of mathematics as a subject in its own right.<ref>{{cite book |last=Heath |first=Thomas Little |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofgreekma0002heat/page/n14 |url-access=registration |page=1 |title=A History of Greek Mathematics: From Thales to Euclid |location=New York |publisher=Dover Publications |date=1981 |orig-year=1921 |isbn=978-0-486-24073-2}}</ref> Around 300 BC, [[Euclid]] introduced the [[axiomatic method]] still used in mathematics today, consisting of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. His book, ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', is widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Euclid of Alexandria" p. 119}} The greatest mathematician of antiquity is often held to be [[Archimedes]] (c. 287–212 BC) of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]].{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 120}} He developed formulas for calculating the surface area and volume of [[solids of revolution]] and used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the [[Series (mathematics)|summation of an infinite series]], in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus.{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Archimedes of Syracuse" p. 130}} Other notable achievements of Greek mathematics are [[conic sections]] ([[Apollonius of Perga]], 3rd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc="Apollonius of Perga" p. 145}} [[trigonometry]] ([[Hipparchus of Nicaea]], 2nd century BC),{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Greek Trigonometry and Mensuration" p. 162}} and the beginnings of algebra ([[Diophantus]], 3rd century AD).{{sfn|Boyer|1991|loc= "Revival and Decline of Greek Mathematics" p. 180}}

The [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in [[Indian mathematics|India]] and were transmitted to the [[Western world]] via [[Islamic mathematics]]. Other notable developments of Indian mathematics include the modern definition and approximation of [[sine]] and [[cosine]], and an early form of [[infinite series]].

[[File:Fibonacci.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo Fibonacci]], the Italian mathematician who introduced the [[Hindu–Arabic numeral system]] invented between the 1st and 4th&nbsp;centuries by Indian mathematicians, to the Western World.]]
During the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]], especially during the 9th and 10th&nbsp;centuries, mathematics saw many important innovations building on Greek mathematics. The most notable achievement of [[Islamic mathematics]] was the development of [[algebra]]. Other achievements of the Islamic period include advances in [[spherical trigonometry]] and the addition of the [[decimal point]] to the Arabic numeral system.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Saliba, George.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/28723059|title=A history of Arabic astronomy : planetary theories during the golden age of Islam|date=1994|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=978-0-8147-7962-0|oclc=28723059|access-date=May 29, 2020|archive-date=March 31, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210331144039/https://www.worldcat.org/title/history-of-arabic-astronomy-planetary-theories-during-the-golden-age-of-islam/oclc/28723059|url-status=live}}</ref> Many notable mathematicians from this period were Persian, such as [[Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi|Al-Khwarismi]], [[Omar Khayyam]] and [[Sharaf al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī]].

During the [[early modern period]], mathematics began to develop at an accelerating pace in [[Western Europe]]. The development of [[calculus]] by [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Gottfried Leibniz]] in the 17th century revolutionized mathematics. [[Leonhard Euler]] was the most notable mathematician of the 18th century, contributing numerous theorems and discoveries. Perhaps the foremost mathematician of the 19th century was the German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Carl Gauss]], who made numerous contributions to fields such as [[algebra]], [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], [[differential geometry and topology|differential geometry]], [[matrix theory]], [[number theory]], and [[statistics]]. In the early 20th century, [[Kurt Gödel]] transformed mathematics by publishing his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]], which show in part that any consistent axiomatic system—if powerful enough to describe arithmetic—will contain true propositions that cannot be proved.

Mathematics has since been greatly extended, and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and [[science]], to the benefit of both. Mathematical discoveries continue to be made today. According to Mikhail B. Sevryuk, in the January&nbsp;2006 issue of the ''[[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]]'', "The number of papers and books included in the ''[[Mathematical Reviews]]'' database since 1940 (the first year of operation of MR) is now more than 1.9&nbsp;million, and more than 75&nbsp;thousand items are added to the database each year. The overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical [[theorem]]s and their [[mathematical proof|proofs]]."{{sfn|Sevryuk|2006|pp=101–09}}

===Etymology===
The word ''mathematics'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]] ''máthēma'' (''{{Lang-grc|{{wikt-lang|en|μάθημα}}|label=none}}''), meaning "that which is learnt,"<ref>{{cite dictionary|title=mathematic (n.)|dictionary=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&allowed_in_frame=0|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307093926/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=mathematic&allowed_in_frame=0|archive-date=March 7, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "what one gets to know," hence also "study" and "science". The word for "mathematics" came to have the narrower and more technical meaning "mathematical study" even in Classical times.<ref>Both meanings can be found in Plato, the narrower in [[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Rep.+6.510c&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168 510c] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224152747/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plat.+Rep.+6.510c&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168 |date=February 24, 2021 }}, but Plato did not use a ''math-'' word; Aristotle did, commenting on it. {{LSJ|maqhmatiko/s|μαθηματική|ref}}. ''OED Online'', "Mathematics".</ref> Its [[adjective]] is ''mathēmatikós'' ({{lang|grc|μαθηματικός}}), meaning "related to learning" or "studious," which likewise further came to mean "mathematical." In particular, ''mathēmatikḗ tékhnē'' ({{lang|grc|μαθηματικὴ τέχνη}}; {{lang-la|ars mathematica}}) meant "the mathematical art."

Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in [[Pythagoreanism]] was known as the ''mathēmatikoi'' (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "learners" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense.

In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term ''mathematics'' more commonly meant "[[astrology]]" (or sometimes "[[astronomy]]") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This has resulted in several mistranslations. For example, [[Saint Augustine]]'s warning that Christians should beware of ''mathematici'', meaning astrologers, is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.<ref name="Boas">{{cite book | title=Lion Hunting and Other Mathematical Pursuits: A Collection of Mathematics, Verse, and Stories by the Late Ralph P. Boas, Jr | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Boas, Ralph | author-link=Ralph P.

The apparent [[plural]] form in English, like the French plural form {{lang|fr|les mathématiques}} (and the less commonly used singular [[Morphological derivation|derivative]] {{lang|fr|la mathématique}}), goes back to the Latin [[Neuter (grammar)|neuter]] plural {{lang|la|mathematica}} ([[Cicero]]), based on the Greek plural ''ta mathēmatiká'' ({{lang|el|τὰ μαθηματικά}}), used by [[Aristotle]] (384–322&nbsp;BC), and meaning roughly "all things mathematical", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective ''mathematic(al)'' and formed the noun ''mathematics'' anew, after the pattern of ''[[physics]]'' and ''[[metaphysics]]'', which were inherited from Greek.<ref>''[[The Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology]]'', ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''sub'' "mathematics", "mathematic", "mathematics"</ref> In English, the noun ''mathematics'' takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to ''maths'' or, in North America, ''math''.<ref name=maths>[http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 "maths, ''n.''"] and [http://oed.com/view/Entry/114962 "math, ''n.3''"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404201407/http://oed.com/view/Entry/114982 |date=April 4, 2020 }}.

==Philosophy of mathematics==
{{main|Philosophy of mathematics|Definitions of mathematics}}
There is no general consensus about the [[epistemology|epistemological status]] of mathematics.<ref name="Mura" /><ref name="Runge" /> [[Aristotle]] defined mathematics as "the science of quantity" and this definition prevailed until the 18th century. However, Aristotle also noted a focus on quantity alone may not distinguish mathematics from sciences like physics; in his view, abstraction and studying quantity as a property "separable in thought" from real instances set mathematics apart.<ref name="Franklin">{{Cite book|last=Franklin|first=James|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&pg=PA104|title=Philosophy of Mathematics|date=2009-07-08|isbn=978-0-08-093058-9|pages=104–106|access-date=July 1, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906134402/https://books.google.com/books?id=mbn35b2ghgkC&pg=PA104#v=onepage&q&f=false|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 19th&nbsp;century, when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as [[group theory]] and [[projective geometry]], which have no clear-cut relation to quantity and measurement, mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions.<ref name="Cajori">{{cite book|author=Cajori, Florian|title=A History of Mathematics|publisher=American Mathematical Society (1991 reprint)|year=1893|isbn=978-0-8218-2102-2|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&pg=PA285 285–86]|author-link=Florian Cajori}}</ref>

A great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics, or consider it undefinable.<ref name="Mura" /> There is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science.<ref name="Runge" /> Some just say, "Mathematics is what mathematicians do."<ref name="Mura" />

=== Three leading types ===
Three leading types of definition of mathematics today are called [[logicist]], [[intuitionist]], and [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]], each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought.<ref name="Snapper">{{Cite journal |doi=10.2307/2689412 |title=The Three Crises in Mathematics: Logicism, Intuitionism, and Formalism |journal=Mathematics Magazine |date=September 1979 |first=Ernst |last=Snapper |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=207–16 |jstor=2689412 }}</ref> All have severe flaws, none has widespread acceptance, and no reconciliation seems possible.<ref name="Snapper" />

==== Logicist definitions ====
An early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was that of [[Benjamin Peirce]] (1870): "the science that draws necessary conclusions."<ref name="Peirce">{{cite book |title=Linear Associative Algebra |publisher=Van Nostrand |author=Peirce, Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Peirce |year=1882 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_De0GAAAAYAAJ/page/n62 1] |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_De0GAAAAYAAJ |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] advanced the philosophical program known as [[logicism]], and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts, statements, and principles can be defined and proved entirely in terms of [[symbolic logic]]. A logicist definition of mathematics is Russell's (1903) "All Mathematics is Symbolic Logic."<ref name="Russell">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesmathe00russgoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/principlesmathe00russgoog/page/n36 5]|title=The Principles of Mathematics|year=1903|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|access-date=June 20, 2015}}</ref>

==== Intuitionist definitions ====
[[Intuitionist]] definitions, developing from the philosophy of mathematician [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena. An example of an intuitionist definition is "Mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other."<ref name=Snapper/> A peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions. In particular, while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proved to exist even though they cannot be constructed, intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct. Intuitionists also reject the [[law of excluded middle]] (i.e., <math>P \vee \neg P</math>). While this stance does force them to reject one common version of [[proof by contradiction]] as a viable proof method, namely the inference of <math>P</math> from <math>\neg P \to \bot</math>, they are still able to infer <math>\neg P</math> from <math>P \to \bot</math>. For them, <math> \neg (\neg P) </math> is a strictly weaker statement than <math> P </math>.<ref name=SEP-P>{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2020/entries/intuitionism/|title=Intuitionism in the Philosophy of Mathematics|first=Rosalie|last=Iemhoff|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=March 4, 2020|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=March 4, 2021|archive-date=March 31, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210331144031/https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2020/entries/intuitionism/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Formalist definitions ====
[[Formalism (mathematics)|Formalist]] definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them. [[Haskell Curry]] defined mathematics simply as "the science of formal systems".<ref name="Curry">{{cite book |title=Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of Mathematics |publisher=Elsevier |author=Curry, Haskell |author-link=Haskell Curry |year=1951 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tZHrBQgp1bkC 56] |isbn=978-0-444-53368-5}}</ref> A [[formal system]] is a set of symbols, or ''tokens'', and some ''rules'' on how the tokens are to be combined into ''formulas''. In formal systems, the word ''axiom'' has a special meaning different from the ordinary meaning of "a self-evident truth", and is used to refer to a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system.

===Mathematics as science===
[[File:Carl Friedrich Gauss.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], known as the prince of mathematicians]]

The German mathematician [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] referred to mathematics as "the Queen of the Sciences".{{sfn|Waltershausen|1965|p=79}} More recently, [[Marcus du Sautoy]] has called mathematics "the Queen of Science&nbsp;... the main driving force behind scientific discovery".<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Nicolas Bourbaki |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |access-date=26 October 2017 |series=A Brief History of Mathematics |first=Marcus |last=du Sautoy |station=BBC Radio 4 |date=25 June 2010 |time=min. 12:50 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216050402/http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00stcgv |archive-date=December 16, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] observed that "most mathematical theories are, like those of [[physics]] and [[biology]], [[hypothesis|hypothetico]]-[[deductive]]: pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures, than it seemed even recently."{{sfn|Popper|1995|p=56}} Popper also noted that "I shall certainly admit a system as empirical or scientific only if it is capable of being tested by experience."<ref>{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |year=2002 |orig-year=[https://books.google.com/?id=KZvXAAAAMAAJ 1959] |title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon-on-Thames |isbn=978-0-415-27843-0 |page=[18]}}</ref>

Several authors consider that mathematics is not a science because it does not rely on [[empirical evidence]].<ref name= "Bishop1991">{{cite book | last1 = Bishop | first1 = Alan | year = 1991 | chapter = Environmental activities and mathematical culture | title = Mathematical Enculturation: A Cultural Perspective on Mathematics Education | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9AgrBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA54 | pages = 20–59 | location = Norwell, Massachusetts | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | isbn = 978-0-792-31270-3 | access-date = April 5, 2020 | archive-date = December 25, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201225195821/https://books.google.com/books?id=9AgrBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA54 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Out of Their Minds: The Lives and Discoveries of 15 Great Computer Scientists |author1=Shasha, Dennis Elliot |author2=Lazere, Cathy A. |publisher=Springer |year=1998 |page=228}}</ref><ref name= "Nickles2013" >{{cite book | last = Nickles | first = Thomas | year = 2013 | chapter = The Problem of Demarcation | title = Philosophy of Pseudoscience: Reconsidering the Demarcation Problem | page = 104 | location = Chicago | publisher = The University of Chicago Press}}</ref><ref name="Pigliucci2014">{{Cite magazine| year = 2014| last = [[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci]]| first = Massimo| title = Are There 'Other' Ways of Knowing?| magazine = [[Philosophy Now]]| url = https://philosophynow.org/issues/102/Are_There_Other_Ways_of_Knowing| access-date = 6 April 2020| archive-date = May 13, 2020| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200513190522/https://philosophynow.org/issues/102/Are_There_Other_Ways_of_Knowing| url-status = live}}</ref>

Mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences, notably the [[deductive reasoning|exploration of the logical consequences]] of assumptions. [[Intuition (knowledge)|Intuition]] and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of [[conjecture]]s in both mathematics and the (other) sciences. [[Experimental mathematics]] continues to grow in importance within mathematics, and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics.

The opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied. Many mathematicians<ref>See, for example [[Bertrand Russell]]'s statement "Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty ..." in his ''History of Western Philosophy''</ref> feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side, and its history in the traditional seven [[liberal arts]]; others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|title=The science checklist applied: Mathematics|website=undsci.berkeley.edu|access-date=2019-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191027021023/https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/mathematics|archive-date=October 27, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> One way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is ''created'' (as in art) or ''discovered'' (as in science). In practice, mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels. This is one of many issues considered in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Borel|first=Armand|date=March 2017|title=Mathematics: Art and Science|journal=EMS Newsletter|volume=3|issue=103|pages=37–45|doi=10.4171/news/103/8|issn=1027-488X|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems. At first these were found in commerce, [[land measurement]], architecture and later [[astronomy]]; today, all sciences pose problems studied by mathematicians, and many problems arise within mathematics itself. For example, the [[physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]] invented the [[path integral formulation]] of [[quantum mechanics]] using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight, and today's [[string theory]], a still-developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four [[Fundamental interaction|fundamental forces of nature]], continues to inspire new mathematics.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=The Feynman Integral and Feynman's Operational Calculus |journal=Physics Today |volume=54 |issue=8 |page=48 |author=Meinhard E. Mayer |year=2001 |bibcode=2001PhT....54h..48J |doi=10.1063/1.1404851}}</ref>

Some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it, and is applied to solve further problems in that area. But often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas, and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts. A distinction is often made between [[pure mathematics]] and [[applied mathematics]]. However pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications, e.g. [[number theory]] in [[cryptography]].

This remarkable fact, that even the "purest" mathematics often turns out to have practical applications, is what the physicist [[Eugene Wigner]] has named "[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences|the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics]]".<ref name=wigner1960>{{cite journal |last=Wigner |first=Eugene |year=1960 |title=The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |journal=[[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1002/cpa.3160130102 |bibcode=1960CPAM...13....1W |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228152633/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html |archive-date=February 28, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The [[philosopher of mathematics]] [[Mark Steiner]] has written extensively on this matter and acknowledges that the applicability of mathematics constitutes “a challenge to naturalism.”<ref>{{cite book |last= Steiner|first= Mark|date= 1998|title= The Applicability of Mathematics as a Philosophical Problem|location= Cambridge, Mass|publisher= Harvard University Press|page= 176|isbn= 0674043987}}</ref> For the philosopher of mathematics [[Mary Leng]], the fact that the physical world acts in accordance with the dictates of non-causal mathematical entities existing beyond the universe is "a happy coincidence".<ref name="Mathematics and Reality">{{cite book |last= Leng|first= Mary|date= 2010|title= Mathematics and Reality|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 239|isbn= 978-0199280797}}</ref> On the other hand, for some  [[anti-realism|anti-realists]], connections, which are acquired among mathematical things, just mirror the connections acquiring among objects in the universe, so that there is no "happy coincidence".<ref name="Mathematics and Reality" />

As in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] runs to 46&nbsp;pages.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |title=Mathematics Subject Classification 2010 |access-date=November 9, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514091144/http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/msc/pdfs/classification2010.pdf |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right, including statistics, [[operations research]], and [[computer science]].

For those who are mathematically inclined, there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics. Many mathematicians talk about the ''elegance'' of mathematics, its intrinsic [[aesthetics]] and inner beauty. [[Simplicity]] and generality are valued. There is beauty in a simple and elegant [[proof (mathematics)|proof]], such as [[Euclid]]'s proof that there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and in an elegant [[numerical method]] that speeds calculation, such as the [[fast Fourier transform]]. [[G. H. Hardy]] in ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]'' expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are, in themselves, sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics. He identified criteria such as significance, unexpectedness, inevitability, and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Mathematician's Apology |author=Hardy, G. H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1940 |isbn=978-0-521-42706-7}}</ref> Mathematical research often seeks critical features of a mathematical object. A theorem expressed as a [[characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the object by these features is the prize. Examples of particularly succinct and revelatory mathematical arguments have been published in ''[[Proofs from THE BOOK]]''.

The popularity of [[recreational mathematics]] is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions. At the other social extreme, philosophers continue to find problems in [[philosophy of mathematics]], such as the nature of [[mathematical proof]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Proof and Other Dilemmas: Mathematics and Philosophy |author1=Gold, Bonnie|author1-link=Bonnie Gold |author2=Simons, Rogers A. |publisher=MAA |year=2008}}</ref>

==Notation, language, and rigor==
{{main|Mathematical notation}}
[[File:Leonhard Euler 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Leonhard Euler]] created and popularized much of the mathematical notation used today.]]

Most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |access-date=September 14, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220073955/http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |archive-date=February 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Before that, mathematics was written out in words, limiting mathematical discovery.{{sfn|Kline|1990|p=140|ps=, on [[Diophantus]]; p. 261, on [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]].}} [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] (1707–1783) was responsible for many of the notations in use today. Modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional, but beginners often find it daunting. According to [[Barbara Oakley]], this can be attributed to the fact that mathematical ideas are both more ''abstract'' and more ''encrypted'' than those of natural language.<ref>{{harvnb|Oakley|2014|p=16|ps=: "Focused problem solving in math and science is often more effortful than focused-mode thinking involving language and people. This may be because humans haven't evolved over the millennia to manipulate mathematical ideas, which are frequently more abstractly encrypted than those of conventional language."}}</ref> Unlike natural language, where people can often equate a word (such as ''cow'') with the physical object it corresponds to, mathematical symbols are abstract, lacking any physical analog.<ref>{{harvnb|Oakley|2014|p=16|ps=: "What do I mean by abstractness? You can point to a real live ''cow'' chewing its cud in a pasture and equate it with the letters ''c–o–w'' on the page. But you can't point to a real live ''plus sign'' that the symbol '+' is modeled after – the idea underlying the plus sign is more ''abstract''."}}</ref> Mathematical symbols are also more highly encrypted than regular words, meaning a single symbol can encode a number of different operations or ideas.<ref>{{harvnb|Oakley|2014|p=16|ps=: "By ''encryptedness'', I mean that one symbol can stand for a number of different operations or ideas, just as the multiplication sign symbolizes repeated addition."}}</ref>

[[Language of mathematics|Mathematical language]] can be difficult to understand for beginners because even common terms, such as ''or'' and ''only'', have a more precise meaning than they have in everyday speech, and other terms such as ''[[open set|open]]'' and ''[[Field (mathematics)|field]]'' refer to specific mathematical ideas, not covered by their laymen's meanings. Mathematical language also includes many technical terms such as ''[[homeomorphism]]'' and ''[[Integral|integrable]]'' that have no meaning outside of mathematics. Additionally, shorthand phrases such as ''iff'' for "[[if and only if]]" belong to [[mathematical jargon]]. There is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary: mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech. Mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as "rigor".

[[Mathematical proof]] is fundamentally a matter of [[rigor]]. Mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning. This is to avoid mistaken "[[theorem]]s", based on fallible intuitions, of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject.{{efn|See ''[[false proof]]'' for simple examples of what can go wrong in a formal proof.}} The level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time: the Greeks expected detailed arguments, but at the time of [[Isaac Newton]] the methods employed were less rigorous. Problems inherent in the definitions used by Newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the 19th&nbsp;century. Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics<!--This part needs improvement |>>-->. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about [[computer-assisted proof]]s. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may be erroneous if the used computer program is erroneous.{{efn|For considering as reliable a large computation occurring in a proof, one generally requires two computations using independent software}}<ref>Ivars Peterson, ''The Mathematical Tourist'', Freeman, 1988, {{isbn|978-0-7167-1953-3}}. p. 4 "A few complain that the computer program can't be verified properly", (in reference to the Haken–Apple proof of the Four Color Theorem).</ref> On the other hand, [[proof assistant]]s allow verifying all details that cannot be given in a hand-written proof, and provide certainty of the correctness of long proofs such as that of the [[Feit–Thompson theorem]].{{efn|The book containing the complete proof has more than 1,000 pages.}}

[[Axiom]]s in traditional thought were "self-evident truths", but that conception is problematic.<ref>"The method of 'postulating' what we want has many advantages; they are the same as the advantages of theft over honest toil." [[Bertrand Russell]] (1919), ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'', New York and London, [http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html p. 71.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620162751/http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Quotations/Russell.html |date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref> At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an [[axiomatic system]]. It was the goal of [[Hilbert's program]] to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] every (sufficiently powerful) axiomatic system has [[independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] formulas; and so a final [[axiomatization]] of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless, mathematics is often imagined to be (as far as its formal content) nothing but [[set theory]] in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.<ref>Patrick Suppes, ''Axiomatic Set Theory'', Dover, 1972, {{isbn|978-0-486-61630-8}}. p. 1, "Among the many branches of modern mathematics set theory occupies a unique place: with a few rare exceptions the entities which are studied and analyzed in mathematics may be regarded as certain particular sets or classes of objects."</ref>

==Mathematical awards==
Arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the [[Fields Medal]],{{sfn|Monastyrsky|2001|p=1|ps=: "The Fields Medal is now indisputably the best known and most influential award in mathematics."}}{{sfn|Riehm|2002|pp=778–82}} established in 1936 and awarded every four years (except around World War II) to as many as four individuals. The Fields Medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the Nobel Prize.

The [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]], instituted in 1978, recognizes lifetime achievement, and another major international award, the [[Abel Prize]], was instituted in 2003. The [[Chern Medal]] was introduced in 2010 to recognize lifetime achievement. These accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work, which may be innovational, or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field.

A famous list of 23 [[open problem]]s, called "[[Hilbert's problems]]", was compiled in 1900 by German mathematician [[David Hilbert]]. This list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians, and at least nine of the problems have now been solved. A new list of seven important problems, titled the "[[Millennium Prize Problems]]", was published in 2000. Only one of them, the [[Riemann hypothesis]], duplicates one of Hilbert's problems. A solution to any of these problems carries a 1 million dollar reward. Currently, only one of these problems, the [[Poincaré conjecture]], has been solved.
