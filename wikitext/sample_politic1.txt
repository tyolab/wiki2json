{{Chinese |t = 義和團運動 |s = 义和团运动 |p = Yìhétuán Yùndòng | w = I-ho-t'uan Yün-tung | l = Militia United in Righteousness Movement}}

The '''Boxer Rebellion''', the '''Boxer Uprising''' or the '''Yihetuan Movement''', was an [[Xenophobia|anti-foreign]], [[Persecution of Christians#China|anti-Christian]] and [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] uprising which was staged in China between 1899 and 1901, towards the end of the [[Qing dynasty]], by the Militia United in Righteousness (''Yìhéquán''), known as the ''[[Boxers (group)|Boxers]]'' in English because many of its members had practised [[Chinese martial arts]], which at the time were referred to as Chinese Boxing.

After the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War of 1895]] villagers in [[North China]] feared the expansion of [[Spheres of influence#China|foreign spheres of influence]] and resented the extension of privileges to Christian missionaries, who used them to support their followers. In 1898, Northern China experienced several natural disasters, including the Yellow River flooding and droughts. Boxers blamed these disasters on foreign influence and China's Christian converts supposedly alienating their traditional Chinese gods. By 1899, violence spread across [[Shandong]] and the [[North China Plain]], destroying foreign property, attacking or murdering Christian missionaries and [[Christianity in China|Chinese Christians]]. In June 1900, Boxer fighters, convinced they were invulnerable to foreign weapons, converged on Beijing with the slogan "Support the Qing government and exterminate the foreigners." Diplomats, missionaries, soldiers and some Chinese Christians took refuge in the diplomatic [[Beijing Legation Quarter|Legation Quarter]] and were besieged for 55 days by the Imperial Army of China and the Boxers.

An [[Eight Nation Alliance]] of American, Austro-Hungarian, British, French, German, Italian, Japanese and Russian troops moved into China to lift the siege and rescue stranded civilians. The [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who had initially been hesitant, now supported the Boxers and on 21 June issued an [[Imperial decree of declaration of war against foreign powers|Imperial Decree]] [[Declaration of war|declaring war]] on the invading powers.  Chinese officialdom was split between those supporting the Boxers and those favouring conciliation, led by [[Yikuang|Prince Qing]]. The supreme commander of the Chinese forces, the Manchu General [[Ronglu]] (Junglu), later claimed he acted to protect the foreigners. Officials in the [[Mutual Defense Pact of the Southeastern Provinces|southern provinces]] ignored the imperial order to fight against foreigners.

The Eight-Nation Alliance, after being initially turned back by the Imperial Chinese military and Boxer militia brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Army in Tianjin, and arrived in Beijing on 14 August, relieving the [[Siege of the International Legations|siege of the Legations]]. Uncontrolled plunder of the capital and the surrounding countryside ensued, along with [[summary execution]] of those suspected of being Boxers. The [[Boxer Protocol]] of 7 September 1901 provided for the execution of government officials who had supported the Boxers, provisions for foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing, and 450&nbsp;million [[tael]]s of silver—approximately $10&nbsp;billion at 2018 silver prices and more than the government's annual [[tax revenue]]—to be paid as [[indemnity]] over the course of the next 39 years to the eight nations involved.

== Historical background ==

=== Origins of the Boxers ===

[[File:Boxer Rebellion.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Boxer Rebellion and Eight-Nation Alliance, China 1900–1901]]

The Righteous and Harmonious Fists (Yihequan) arose in the inland sections of the northern coastal province of [[Shandong]], a region which had long been plagued by social unrest, religious sects, and martial societies. American Christian missionaries were probably the first people who referred to the well-trained, athletic young men as the "Boxers", because of the martial arts which they practiced and the weapons training which they underwent. Their primary practice was a type of [[Chinese spirit possession|spiritual possession]] which involved the whirling of [[sword]]s, violent prostrations, and the chanting of incantations to deities.<ref>Thompson, Larry Clinton (2009), ''William Scott Ament and the Boxer Rebellion: Heroism, Hubris, and the Ideal Missionary'', Jefferson, NC: McFarland and Co., Inc., p. 7</ref>

[[File:BoxerRevolutionarybyGeorgeSStuart.jpg|left|thumb|Boxer with spear and sword
([[Wax sculpture|Wax Model]] by George S. Stuart)]]
The opportunities to fight against Western encroachment and colonization were especially attractive to unemployed village men, many of whom were teenagers.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&pg=PA114 114]}} The tradition of possession and invulnerability went back several hundred years but took on special meaning against the powerful new weapons of the West.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987| pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&pg=PA54 xii, 54- 59, 96, etc.]}} The Boxers, armed with rifles and swords, claimed supernatural invulnerability against cannons, rifle shots, and knife attacks. Furthermore, the Boxer groups popularly claimed that millions of soldiers would descend out of [[Tian|Heaven]] to assist them in purifying China of foreign oppression.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAxresT12ogC&pg=PA112|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=114|isbn=0-7007-1563-0}}</ref>

In 1895, despite ambivalence toward their heterodox practices, [[Yuxian (Qing dynasty)|Yuxian]], a Manchu who was then prefect of [[Cao Prefecture|Caozhou]] and would later become provincial governor, cooperated with the [[Big Swords Society]], whose original purpose was to fight bandits.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997| p=[https://archive.org/details/historyinthreeke00paul/page/19/mode/1up 19-20]}} The missionaries of the German Society of the Divine Word had built up their presence in the area, partially by taking in a significant portion of converts who were "in need of protection from the law".{{sfnb|Cohen|1997| p=[https://archive.org/details/historyinthreeke00paul/page/19/mode/1up 19-20]}} On one occasion in 1895, a large bandit gang defeated by the Big Swords Society claimed to be Catholics to avoid prosecution. "The line between Christians and bandits became increasingly indistinct", remarks Paul Cohen.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997| p=[https://archive.org/details/historyinthreeke00paul/page/19/mode/1up 19-20]}} Some missionaries such as George Stenz also used their privileges to intervene in lawsuits. The Big Swords responded by attacking Catholic properties and [[Church arson|burning]] them.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997| p=[https://archive.org/details/historyinthreeke00paul/page/19/mode/1up 19-20]}} As a result of diplomatic pressure in the capital, Yuxian executed several Big Sword leaders, but did not punish anyone else. More martial secret societies started emerging after this.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997| p=[https://archive.org/details/historyinthreeke00paul/page/19/mode/1up 19-20]}}

The early years saw a variety of village activities, not a broad movement with a united purpose. Martial folk religious societies such as the [[Baguadao]] (Eight Trigrams) prepared the way for the Boxers. Like the Red Boxing school or the [[Plum Flower tradition|Plum Flower Boxers]], the Boxers of Shandong were more concerned with traditional social and moral values, such as filial piety, than with foreign influences. One leader, Zhu Hongdeng (Red Lantern Zhu), started as a wandering healer, specializing in skin ulcers, and gained wide respect by refusing payment for his treatments.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=ky4_whmgIZcC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30 27–30]}} Zhu claimed descent from [[Ming dynasty]] emperors, since his surname was the surname of the Ming imperial family. He announced that his goal was to "Revive the Qing and destroy the foreigners" ("扶清滅洋 ''fu Qing mie yang''").<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAxresT12ogC&pg=PA115|title=The origins of the Boxer War: a multinational study|author=Lanxin Xiang|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|page=115|isbn=0-7007-1563-0}}</ref>

The enemy was foreign influence. They decided the "primary devils" were the Christian missionaries, and the "secondary devils" were the Chinese converts to Christianity. Both had to recant or be driven out or killed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Victor Purcell|title=The Boxer Uprising: A Background Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MeUoD9G9xAC&pg=PA125|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=125|isbn=9780521148122}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Diana Preston|title=The Boxer Rebellion: The Dramatic Story of China's War on Foreigners That Shook the World in the Summer of 1900|url=https://archive.org/details/boxerrebelliondr00dian|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Walker|page=[https://archive.org/details/boxerrebelliondr00dian/page/25 25]|isbn=9780802713612}}</ref>

=== Causes of the conflict and the unrest ===

The combination of extreme weather conditions, Western attempts at colonizing China, and growing anti-imperialist sentiment fueled the movement. First, a drought followed by floods in Shandong province in 1897–1898 forced farmers to flee to cities and seek food. As one observer said, "I am convinced that a few days' heavy rainfall to terminate the long-continued drought ... would do more to restore tranquility than any measures which either the Chinese government or foreign governments can take."{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=9}}

A major cause of discontent in north China was missionary activity. The [[Treaty of Tientsin]] (or Tianjin) and the [[Convention of Peking]], signed in 1860 after the [[Second Opium War]], had granted foreign missionaries the freedom to preach anywhere in China and to buy land on which to build churches.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=77}} On 1 November 1897, a band of armed men who were perhaps members of the [[Big Swords Society]] stormed the residence of a German missionary from the [[Society of the Divine Word]] and killed two priests. This attack is known as the [[Juye Incident]].
When [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] received news of these murders, he dispatched the [[German East Asia Squadron]] to occupy [[Jiaozhou Bay]] on the southern coast of the Shandong peninsula.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&pg=PA363 123]}} In December 1897, Wilhelm II declared his intent to seize territory in China, which triggered a "scramble for [[concession (territory)|concessions]]" by which Britain, France, Russia and Japan also secured their own [[sphere of influence]] in China.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=129–30}} Germany gained exclusive control of developmental loans, mining, and railway ownership in [[Shandong]] province.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jeans |first1=Roger B. |title=Democracy and Socialism in Republican China: The Politics of Zhang Junmai (Carsun Chang), 1906-1941 |date=1997 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=0847687074 |page=28}}</ref> Russia gained influence of all territory north of the Great Wall,<ref name="dallin" /> plus the previous tax exemption for trade in [[Mongolia]] and [[Xinjiang]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Paine|first=S.

In October 1898, a group of Boxers attacked the Christian community of Liyuantun village where a temple to the [[Jade Emperor]] had been converted into a Catholic church. Disputes had surrounded the church since 1869, when the temple had been granted to the Christian residents of the village. This incident marked the first time the Boxers used the slogan "Support the Qing, destroy the foreigners" ("扶清滅洋 ''fu Qing mie yang''") that later characterised them.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=143–144, 163}} The "Boxers" called themselves the "Militia United in Righteousness" for the first time one year later, at the [[Battle of Senluo Temple]] (October 1899), a clash between Boxers and Qing government troops.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=253}} By using the word "Militia" rather than "Boxers", they distanced themselves from forbidden martial arts sects, and tried to give their movement the legitimacy of a group that defended orthodoxy.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p=32}}

Aggression toward missionaries and Christians drew the ire of foreign (mainly European) governments.<ref>Spence (1999) pp. 231–232.</ref> In 1899, the French minister in Beijing helped the missionaries to obtain an edict granting official status to every order in the Roman Catholic hierarchy, enabling local priests to support their people in legal or family disputes and bypass the local officials.

The early growth of the Boxer movement coincided with the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] (11 June – 21 September 1898), in which progressive Chinese officials, with support from Protestant missionaries, persuaded the [[Guangxu Emperor]] to institute sweeping reforms. This alienated many conservative officials, whose opposition led [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] to intervene and reverse the reforms. The failure of the reform movement disillusioned many educated Chinese and thus further weakened the Qing government. The empress seized power and placed the reformist emperor under house arrest.

The national crisis was widely perceived as caused by "foreign aggression" inside.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p=114}} Even though afterwards a majority of Chinese were extremely grateful for the actions of the alliance.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Liu|first=Qikun|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1273665236|title=Ba guo lian jun nai zheng yi zhi shi = Eight-nation alliance|last2=劉淇昆|date=July 2021|isbn=978-957-13-9199-1|edition=Chu ban|location=Tai bei shi|oclc=1273665236}}</ref> At the time, the Qing government were extremely corrupt, common people often faced extortions from government officials and the government offered no protection from the violent actions of the Boxers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Liu|first=Qikun|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1273665236|title=Ba guo lian jun nai zheng yi zhi shi = Eight-nation alliance|last2=劉淇昆|date=July 2021|isbn=978-957-13-9199-1|edition=Chu ban|location=Tai bei shi|oclc=1273665236}}</ref>

Bodin |year=1979 |publisher=Osprey |pages=26, 40 |isbn=0-85045-335-6 }}</ref> ]]

In January 1900, with a majority of conservatives in the imperial court, Empress Dowager Cixi changed her position on the Boxers, and issued edicts in their defence, causing protests from foreign powers. In spring 1900, the Boxer movement spread rapidly north from Shandong into the countryside near Beijing. Boxers burned Christian churches, killed Chinese Christians and intimidated Chinese officials who stood in their way. American Minister [[Edwin H. Conger]] cabled Washington, "the whole country is swarming with hungry, discontented, hopeless idlers." On 30 May the diplomats, led by British Minister [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald]], requested that foreign soldiers come to Beijing to defend the legations. The Chinese government reluctantly acquiesced, and the next day a multinational force of 435 navy troops from eight countries debarked from warships and travelled by train from [[Taku Forts|Dagu (Taku)]] to Beijing.

=== Seymour Expedition ===
{{main|Seymour Expedition}}
[[File:BoxerJapaneseMarines.jpg|thumb|left|Japanese marines who served in the [[Seymour Expedition]]]]

As the situation grew more violent, a second multinational force of 2,000 sailors and marines under the command of the British vice-admiral [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Edward Seymour]], the largest contingent being British, was dispatched from Dagu to Beijing on 10 June 1900. The troops were transported by train from Dagu to Tianjin with the agreement of the Chinese government, but the railway between Tianjin and Beijing had been severed. Seymour resolved to move forward and repair the railway, or progress on foot if necessary, keeping in mind that the distance between Tianjin and Beijing was only 120&nbsp;km. When Seymour left Tianjin and started toward Beijing, it angered the imperial court.

As a result, the pro-Boxer Manchu Prince Duan became leader of the Zongli Yamen (foreign office), replacing Prince Qing. Prince Duan was a member of the imperial [[Aisin Gioro]] clan (foreigners called him a "Blood Royal"), and Empress Dowager Cixi had named her son as next in line for the [[Dragon Throne|imperial throne]]. He became the effective leader of the Boxers, and was extremely anti-foreigner. He soon ordered the Qing imperial army to attack the foreign forces. Confused by conflicting orders from Beijing, General [[Nie Shicheng]] let Seymour's army pass by in their trains.{{sfn|Leonhard|p=12}}

[[File:SeymourTianjin.jpg|thumb|Admiral Seymour returning to Tianjin with his wounded men on 26 June]]

After leaving Tianjin, the convoy quickly reached Langfang, but found the railway there to be destroyed. Seymour's engineers tried to repair the line, but the allied army found itself surrounded, as the railway both behind and in front of them had been destroyed. They were attacked from all parts by Chinese irregulars and Chinese governmental troops. Five thousand of Dong Fuxiang's "[[Kansu Braves|Gansu Braves]]" and an unknown number of "Boxers" won a costly but major victory over Seymour's troops at the [[Battle of Langfang]] on 18 June.{{sfn|Leonhard|p=18}}{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=ky4_whmgIZcC&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49 49]}} As the allied European army retreated from Langfang, they were constantly fired upon by cavalry, and artillery bombarded their positions. It was reported that the Chinese artillery was superior to the European artillery, since the Europeans did not bother to bring along much for the campaign, thinking they could easily sweep through Chinese resistance.

The Europeans could not locate the Chinese artillery, which was raining shells upon their positions.<ref name="smith1901">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmAuAAAAYAAJ |title=China in Convulsion |volume=2 |first=Arthur Henderson |last=Smith |year=1901 |publisher=F.

News arrived on 18 June regarding attacks on foreign legations. Seymour decided to continue advancing, this time along the Beihe river, toward [[Tongzhou, Hebei|Tongzhou]], {{convert|25|km|sp=us|abbr=on}} from Beijing. By the 19th, they had to abandon their efforts due to progressively stiffening resistance and started to retreat southward along the river with over 200 wounded. Commandeering four civilian Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] along the river, they loaded all their wounded and remaining supplies onto them and pulled them along with ropes from the riverbanks. By this point, they were very low on food, ammunition and medical supplies. They happened upon [[The Great Hsi-Ku Arsenal|the Great Xigu Arsenal]], a hidden Qing munitions cache of which the Allied Powers had had no knowledge until then. They immediately captured and occupied it, discovering [[Krupp]] field guns and rifles with millions of rounds of ammunition, along with millions of pounds of rice and ample medical supplies.

There they dug in and awaited rescue. A Chinese servant was able to infiltrate the Boxer and Qing lines, informing the Eight Powers of the Seymour troops' predicament. Surrounded and attacked nearly around the clock by Qing troops and Boxers, they were at the point of being overrun. On 25 June, a regiment composed of 1,800 men (900 Russian troops from [[Lüshunkou|Port Arthur]], 500 British seamen, with an ad hoc mix of other assorted Alliance troops) finally arrived on foot from Tientsin to rescue Seymour. Spiking the mounted field guns and setting fire to any munitions that they could not take (an estimated £3&nbsp;million worth), Seymour, his force, and the rescue mission marched back to Tientsin, unopposed, on 26 June. Seymour's casualties during the expedition were 62 killed and 228 wounded.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p=100–104}}

=== Conflicting attitudes within the Qing imperial court ===

[[File:Qing Imperial Army.jpg|thumb|Qing imperial soldiers during the Boxer Rebellion]]

Meanwhile, in Beijing, on 16 June, Empress Dowager Cixi summoned the imperial court for a mass audience and addressed the choice between using the Boxers to evict the foreigners from the city and seeking a diplomatic solution. In response to a high official who doubted the efficacy of the Boxers, Cixi replied that both sides of the debate at the imperial court realised that popular support for the Boxers in the countryside was almost universal and that suppression would be both difficult and unpopular, especially when foreign troops were on the march.{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=jVESdBSMasMC&lpg=PA289 289–290]}}<ref name="Purcell2010">{{cite book|author=Victor Purcell|title=The Boxer Uprising: A Background Study|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MeUoD9G9xAC&q=cannot%20rely%20charms%20heart%20people%20lose&pg=PA250|date=3 June 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-14812-2|pages=250–}}</ref>

Two factions were active during this debate. On one side were anti-foreigners who viewed foreigners as invasive and imperialistic and evoked a nativist populism. They advocated taking advantage of the Boxers to achieve the expulsion of foreign troops and foreign influences. The pro-foreigners on the other hand advanced rapprochement with foreign governments, seeing the Boxers as superstitious and ignorant.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The event that tilted the Qing imperial government irrevocably toward support of the Boxers and war with the foreign powers was the attack of foreign navies on the [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|Dagu Forts]] near Tianjin, on 17 June 1900.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

On 15 June, Qing imperial forces deployed electric [[Naval mine|mines]] in the [[Beihe river]] (Peiho) to prevent the Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/reportsonmilita01divigoog|title=Reports on Military Operations in South Africa and China|authors=Stephan L'H.

With a difficult military situation in Tianjin and a total breakdown of communications between Tianjin and Beijing, the allied nations took steps to reinforce their military presence significantly. On 17 June they took the Dagu Forts commanding the approaches to Tianjin, and from there brought increasing numbers of troops on shore. When Cixi received an ultimatum that same day demanding that China surrender total control over all its military and financial affairs to foreigners,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Last Empress: The She-Dragon of China|author=Keith Laidler|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLPZ7294oSIC&pg=PA221|isbn=0-470-86426-5}}</ref> she defiantly stated before the entire [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]], "Now they [the Powers] have started the aggression, and the extinction of our nation is imminent. If we just fold our arms and yield to them, I would have no face to see our ancestors after death. If we must perish, why don't we fight to the death?"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Boxer catastrophe|issue=Issue 583 of Columbia Studies in the Social Sciences|author=Chester C.

It was at this point that Cixi began to blockade the legations with the armies of the [[Peking Field Force]], which began the siege. Cixi stated that "I have always been of the opinion, that the allied armies had been permitted to escape too easily [[Second Opium War|in 1860]]. Only a united effort was then necessary to have given China the victory. Today, at last, the opportunity for revenge has come", and said that millions of Chinese would join the cause of fighting the foreigners since the Manchus had provided "great benefits" on China.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Spirit Soldiers: A Historical Narrative of the Boxer Rebellion|author=Richard O'Connor| year=1973|edition=illustrated| publisher=Putnam|page=85|isbn=9780399112164| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P4NxAAAAMAAJ&q=extinction+imminent}}</ref>
On receipt of the news of the attack on the [[Dagu Fort]]s on 19 June, Empress Dowager Cixi immediately sent an order to the legations that the diplomats and other foreigners depart Beijing under escort of the Chinese army within 24 hours.<ref>Tan, p. 75</ref>

The next morning, diplomats from the besieged legations met to discuss the Empress's offer. The majority quickly agreed that they could not trust the Chinese army. Fearing that they would be killed, they agreed to refuse the Empress's demand. The German Imperial Envoy, Baron Klemens Freiherr von Ketteler, was infuriated with the actions of the Chinese army troops and determined to take his complaints to the royal court. Against the advice of the fellow foreigners, the baron left the legations with a single aide and a team of porters to carry his sedan chair. On his way to the palace, von Ketteler was killed on the streets of Beijing by a Manchu captain.<ref>{{cite book|title=Warriors of the Rising Sun: A History of the Japanese Military|author=Robert B.

At this news, the other diplomats feared they also would be murdered if they left the legation quarter and they chose to continue to defy the Chinese order to depart Beijing. The legations were hurriedly fortified. Most of the foreign civilians, which included a large number of missionaries and businessmen, took refuge in the British legation, the largest of the diplomatic compounds.<ref>Diana Preston, page 87, "A Brief History of the Boxer Rebellion", {{ISBN|1-84119-490-5}}</ref> Chinese Christians were primarily housed in the adjacent palace (Fu) of Prince Su who was forced to abandon his property by the foreign soldiers.<ref>Diana Preston, page 79, "A Brief History of the Boxer Rebellion", {{ISBN|1-84119-490-5}}</ref>

The legations of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, the United States, Russia and Japan were located in the [[Beijing Legation Quarter]] south of the [[Forbidden City]]. The Chinese army and Boxer irregulars besieged the Legation Quarter from 20 June to 14 August 1900. A total of 473 foreign civilians, 409 soldiers, marines and sailors from eight countries, and about 3,000 Chinese Christians took refuge there.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=84–85}} Under the command of the British minister to China, [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald]], the legation staff and military guards defended the compound with small arms, three machine guns, and one old muzzle-loaded cannon, which was nicknamed the ''International Gun'' because the barrel was British, the carriage Italian, the shells Russian and the crew American. Chinese Christians in the legations led the foreigners to the cannon and it proved important in the defence. Also under siege in Beijing was the [[Church of the Saviour, Beijing|Northern Cathedral]] (''Beitang'') of the Catholic Church. The Beitang was defended by 43 French and Italian soldiers, 33 Catholic foreign priests and nuns, and about 3,200 Chinese Catholics. The defenders suffered heavy casualties especially from lack of food and mines which the Chinese exploded in tunnels dug beneath the compound.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p=85, 170–171}} The number of Chinese soldiers and Boxers besieging the Legation Quarter and the Beitang is unknown.

On 22 and 23 June, Chinese soldiers and Boxers set fire to areas north and west of the British Legation, using it as a "frightening tactic" to attack the defenders. The nearby [[Hanlin Academy]], a complex of courtyards and buildings that housed "the quintessence of Chinese scholarship ... the oldest and richest library in the world", caught fire. Each side blamed the other for the destruction of the invaluable books it contained.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-davd.htm|title=Destruction of Chinese Books in the Peking Siege of 1900.

After the failure to burn out the foreigners, the Chinese army adopted an anaconda-like strategy. The Chinese built barricades surrounding the Legation Quarter and advanced, brick by brick, on the foreign lines, forcing the foreign legation guards to retreat a few feet at a time. This tactic was especially used in the Fu, defended by Japanese and Italian sailors and soldiers, and inhabited by most of the Chinese Christians. Fusillades of bullets, artillery and firecrackers were directed against the Legations almost every night—but did little damage. Sniper fire took its toll among the foreign defenders. Despite their numerical advantage, the Chinese did not attempt a direct assault on the Legation Quarter although in the words of one of the besieged, "it would have been easy by a strong, swift movement on the part of the numerous Chinese troops to have annihilated the whole body of foreigners ... in an hour."<ref>Smith, Arthur H.

The Germans and the Americans occupied perhaps the most crucial of all defensive positions: the Tartar Wall. Holding the top of the {{convert |45|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert |40|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide wall was vital. The German barricades faced east on top of the wall and {{convert |400|yd|m|abbr=on}} west were the west-facing American positions. The Chinese advanced toward both positions by building barricades even closer. "The men all feel they are in a trap", said the American commander, Capt. [[John Twiggs Myers|John T. Myers]], "and simply await the hour of execution."<ref>Myers, Captain John T. "Military Operations and Defenses of the Siege of Peking." ''Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute'', September 1902, pp. 542–50.</ref> On 30 June, the Chinese forced the Germans off the Wall, leaving the American Marines alone in its defence.

At the same time, a Chinese barricade was advanced to within a few feet of the American positions and it became clear that the Americans had to abandon the wall or force the Chinese to retreat. At 2&nbsp;am on 3 July, 56 British, Russian and American marines and sailors, under the command of Myers, launched an assault against the Chinese barricade on the wall. The attack caught the Chinese sleeping, killed about 20 of them, and expelled the rest of them from the barricades.<ref>Oliphant, Nigel, ''A Diary of the Siege of the Legations in Peking''.

Sir Claude MacDonald said 13 July was the "most harassing day" of the siege.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p=157–158}} The Japanese and Italians in the Fu were driven back to their last defence line. The Chinese detonated a mine beneath the French Legation pushing the French and Austrians out of most of the French Legation.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p=157–158}} On 16 July, the most capable British officer was killed and the journalist [[George Ernest Morrison]] was wounded.<ref>Thompson, Peter and Macklin, Robert ''The Man who Died Twice: The Life and Adventures of Morrison of Peking''.

The motivation of the Chinese was probably the realization that an allied force of 20,000 men had landed in China and retribution for the siege was at hand.

At the [[Battle of Tientsin|Battle of Tianjin (Tientsin)]], General Nie decided to sacrifice his life by walking into the range of Allied guns.{{sfnb|Elliott|2002|p = 499}}

[[Xu Jingcheng]], who had served as the Qing Envoy to many of the same states under siege in the Legation Quarter, argued that "the evasion of extraterritorial rights and the killing of foreign diplomats are unprecedented in China and abroad."<ref>{{citation |author=趙爾巽等撰 |year=1976 |title=Qing shi gao |last3=Zhao |first3=Erxun |author2=趙爾巽 |publisher=新華書店北京發行所發行, Beijing |oclc=17045858| ref = none}}</ref> Xu and five other officials urged Empress Dowager Cixi to order the repression of Boxers, the execution of their leaders, and a diplomatic settlement with foreign armies. The Empress Dowager, outraged, sentenced Xu and the five others to death for "willfully and absurdly petitioning the Imperial Court" and "building subversive thought." They were executed on 28 July 1900 and their severed heads placed on display at [[Caishikou Execution Grounds]] in Beijing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.ihp.sinica.edu.tw/ttscgi/ttsquery?0:0:mctauac:TM%3D%B3%5C%B4%BA%BC%E1|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121222084857/http://archive.ihp.sinica.edu.tw/ttscgi/ttsquery?0:0:mctauac:TM%3D%B3%5C%B4%BA%BC%E1|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-12-22|title=資料連結}}</ref>

[[File:Dong Fuxiang.jpg|thumb|upright|Han Chinese general [[Dong Fuxiang]] was overtly hostile to foreigners and his "Gansu Braves" relentlessly attacked the besieged legations.]]

Reflecting this vacillation, some Chinese soldiers were quite liberally firing at foreigners under siege from its very onset. Cixi did not personally order imperial troops to conduct a siege, and on the contrary had ordered them to protect the foreigners in the legations. Prince Duan led the Boxers to loot his enemies within the imperial court and the foreigners, although imperial authorities expelled Boxers after they were let into the city and went on a looting rampage against both the foreign and the Qing imperial forces. Older Boxers were sent outside Beijing to halt the approaching foreign armies, while younger men were absorbed into the Muslim Gansu army.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNPFc7kkjwAC&pg=PA88|title=Imperial masquerade: the legend of Princess Der Ling|author=Grant Hayter-Menzies |year=2008|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=88|isbn=978-962-209-881-7}}</ref>

With conflicting allegiances and priorities motivating the various forces inside Beijing, the situation in the city became increasingly confused. The foreign legations continued to be surrounded by both Qing imperial and Gansu forces. While Dong Fuxiang's Gansu army, now swollen by the addition of the Boxers, wished to press the siege, Ronglu's imperial forces seem to have largely attempted to follow Empress Dowager Cixi's decree and protect the legations. However, to satisfy the conservatives in the imperial court, Ronglu's men also fired on the legations and let off firecrackers to give the impression that they, too, were attacking the foreigners. Inside the legations and out of communication with the outside world, the foreigners simply fired on any targets that presented themselves, including messengers from the imperial court, civilians and besiegers of all persuasions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNPFc7kkjwAC&pg=PA88|title=Imperial Masquerade: The Legend of Princess Der Ling|author1=Grant Hayter-Menzies |year=2008|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|page=89|isbn=978-962-209-881-7}}</ref> Dong Fuxiang was denied artillery held by Ronglu which stopped him from leveling the legations, and when he complained to Empress Dowager Cixi on 23 June, she dismissively said that "Your tail is becoming too heavy to wag." The Alliance discovered large amounts of unused Chinese Krupp artillery and shells after the siege was lifted.{{sfnb|Fleming|1959|p=226}}

The armistice, although occasionally broken, endured until 13 August when, with an allied army led by the British [[Alfred Gaselee]] approaching Beijing to relieve the siege, the Chinese launched their heaviest fusillade on the Legation Quarter. As the foreign army approached, Chinese forces melted away.

=== Gaselee Expedition ===
{{main|Eight-Nation Alliance|Gaselee Expedition}}
{{Boxer Rebellion}}

Foreign navies started building up their presence along the northern China coast from the end of April 1900. Several international forces were sent to the capital, with varying success, and the Chinese forces were ultimately defeated by the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Imperial Japan|Japan]], [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], the United Kingdom and the United States. Independent of the alliance, the Netherlands dispatched three cruisers in July to protect its citizens in Shanghai.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Nordholt |editor-first=J. W.

British Lieutenant-General [[Alfred Gaselee]] acted as the commanding officer of the Eight-Nation Alliance, which eventually numbered 55,000. The main contingent was composed of Japanese (20,840), Russian (13,150), British (12,020), French (3,520), U.S. (3,420), German (900), Italian (80), Austro-Hungarian (75) and anti-Boxer Chinese troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russojapanesewar.com/boxers.html |title=Russojapanesewarweb |publisher=Russojapanesewar.com |date=1 July 1902 |access-date=6 September 2012}}</ref> The "First Chinese Regiment" ([[Weihaiwei Regiment]]) which was praised for its performance, consisted of Chinese collaborators serving in the British military.<ref name="Powell2015">{{cite book|author=Ralph L.

The international force finally captured [[Tianjin]] on 14 July. The international force suffered its heaviest casualties of the Boxer Rebellion in the [[Battle of Tientsin|Battle of Tianjin]].<ref>Thompson, pp 130, 138</ref> With Tianjin as a base, the international force marched from Tianjin to Beijing, about 120&nbsp;km, with 20,000 allied troops. On 4 August, there were approximately 70,000 Qing imperial troops and anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 Boxers along the way. The allies only encountered minor resistance, fighting battles at [[Battle of Beicang|Beicang]] and [[Battle of Yangcun|Yangcun]]. At Yangcun, the [[14th Infantry Regiment (United States)|14th Infantry Regiment]] of the U.S. and British troops led the assault. The weather was a major obstacle. Conditions were extremely humid with temperatures sometimes reaching {{convert|42|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. These high temperatures and insects plagued the Allies. Soldiers became dehydrated and horses died. Chinese villagers killed Allied troops who searched for wells.{{sfnb|Edgerton|1997|p=[https://archive.org/details/warriorsofrising00edge 88]}}

[[File:Chinese Soldiers 1900.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese troops wearing modern uniforms in 1900]]

The international force reached Beijing on 14 August. Following the defeat of Beiyang army in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the Chinese government had invested heavily in modernizing the imperial army, which was equipped with modern [[Mauser]] repeater rifles and [[Krupp]] artillery. Three modernized divisions consisting of Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] protected the Beijing Metropolitan region. Two of them were under the command of the anti-Boxer [[Yikuang|Prince Qing]] and Ronglu, while the anti-foreign Prince Duan commanded the ten-thousand-strong [[Hushenying]], or "Tiger Spirit Division", which had joined the Gansu Braves and Boxers in attacking the foreigners. It was a Hushenying captain who had assassinated the German diplomat Ketteler. The Tenacious Army under Nie Shicheng received Western style training under German and Russian officers in addition to their modernised weapons and uniforms. They effectively resisted the Alliance at the [[Battle of Tientsin]] before retreating and astounded the Alliance forces with the accuracy of their artillery during the siege of the Tianjin concessions (the artillery shells failed to explode upon impact due to corrupt manufacturing). The Gansu Braves under Dong Fuxiang, which some sources described as "ill disciplined", were armed with modern weapons but were not trained according to Western drill and wore traditional Chinese uniforms. They led the defeat of the Alliance at Langfang in the Seymour Expedition and were the most ferocious in besieging the Legations in Beijing. Some [[Eight Banner|Banner]] forces were given modernised weapons and Western training, becoming the Metropolitan Banner forces, which were decimated in the fighting. Among the Manchu dead was the father of the writer [[Lao She]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The British won the race among the international forces to be the first to reach the besieged Legation Quarter. The U.S. was able to play a role due to the presence of U.S. ships and troops stationed in [[Manila]] since the U.S. conquest of the Philippines during the [[Spanish–American War]] and the subsequent [[Philippine–American War]]. In the U.S. military, the action in the Boxer Rebellion was known as the [[China Relief Expedition]].

=== Evacuation of the Qing imperial court from Beijing to Xi'an ===

[[File:BoxerTroops.jpg|thumb|Painting of Western, Russian and Japanese troops]]

In the early hours of 15 August, just as the Foreign Legations were being relieved, Empress Dowager Cixi, dressed in the padded blue cotton of a farm woman, the Guangxu Emperor, and a small retinue climbed into three wooden ox carts and escaped from the city covered with rough blankets. Legend has it that the Empress Dowager then either ordered that the Guangxu Emperor's favourite concubine, [[Consort Zhen]], be thrown down a well in the Forbidden City or tricked her into drowning herself. The journey was made all the more arduous by the lack of preparation, but the Empress Dowager insisted this was not a retreat, rather a "tour of inspection." After weeks of travel, the party arrived in [[Xi'an]] in [[Shaanxi]] province, beyond protective mountain passes where the foreigners could not reach, deep in Chinese Muslim territory and protected by the Gansu Braves. The foreigners had no orders to pursue the Empress Dowager, so they decided to stay put.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|pp=253–261}}

== Russian invasion of Manchuria ==

[[File:Russian soldiers during the boxer rebellion.jpg|left|thumb|Russian officers in Manchuria during the Boxer Rebellion]]{{Main|Russian invasion of Manchuria}}
The Russian Empire and the Qing Empire had maintained a long peace, starting with the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] in 1689, but Russian forces took advantage of Chinese defeats to impose the [[Aigun Treaty]] of 1858 and the [[Treaty of Peking]] of 1860 which ceded formerly Chinese territory in Manchuria to Russia, much of which is held by Russia to the present day ([[Primorye]]). The Russians aimed for control over the [[Amur River]] for navigation, and the all-weather ports of [[Dairen]] and [[Port Arthur naval base|Port Arthur]] in the [[Liaodong]] peninsula. The rise of Japan as an Asian power provoked Russia's anxiety, especially in light of expanding Japanese influence in [[Korea]]. Following Japan's victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1895, the [[Triple Intervention]] of Russia, Germany and France forced Japan to return the territory won in Liaodong, leading to a de facto Sino-Russian alliance.

Local Chinese in Manchuria were incensed at these Russian advances and began to harass Russians and Russian institutions, such as the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]]. In June 1900, the Chinese bombarded the town of [[Blagoveshchensk]] on the Russian side of the Amur. The Czar's government used the pretext of Boxer activity to move some 200,000 troops into the area to [[Crushing of boxers in Northern and Central Manchuria|crush the Boxers]]. The Chinese used arson to destroy a bridge carrying a railway and a barracks on 27 July. The [[Boxers attacks on Chinese Eastern Railway|Boxers destroyed railways and cut lines for telegraphs]] and burned the Yantai mines.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HvhEAAAAIAAJ|title=The Russo-Chinese War|author=George Alexander Lensen|year=1967|publisher=Diplomatic Press|page=14}}</ref>

By 21 September, Russian troops took [[Jilin]] and Liaodong, and by the end of the month completely occupied Manchuria, where their presence was a major factor leading to the [[Russo-Japanese War]].{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The Chinese [[Honghuzi]] bandits of Manchuria, who had fought alongside the Boxers in the war, did not stop when the Boxer rebellion was over, and continued guerrilla warfare against the Russian occupation up to the [[Russo-Japanese war]] when the Russians were defeated by Japan.

== Massacre of missionaries and Chinese Christians ==

[[File:Chinese Martirs.jpg|thumb|The [[Chinese Martyrs|Holy Chinese Martyrs]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] as depicted in an [[icon]] commissioned in 1990]]

Orthodox, Protestant, and Catholic missionaries and their Chinese parishioners were massacred throughout northern China, some by Boxers and others by government troops and authorities. After the declaration of war on Western powers in June 1900, Yuxian, who had been named governor of [[Shanxi]] in March of that year, implemented a brutal anti-foreign and anti-Christian policy. On 9 July, reports circulated that he had executed forty-four foreigners (including women and children) from missionary families whom he had invited to the provincial capital [[Taiyuan]] under the promise to protect them.{{sfnb|Cohen|1997|p= 51}}{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|pp= 190–191}} Although the purported [[Witness|eyewitness]] accounts have recently been questioned as improbable, this event became a notorious symbol of Chinese anger, known as the [[Taiyuan Massacre]].<ref>Roger R. Thompson,  "Reporting the Taiyuan Massacre: Culture and Politics in the China War of 1900", in Robert A. Bickers and [[R. G. Tiedemann]], ed., ''The Boxers, China, and the World'' (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2007): 65–92. Thompson points out that the widely circulated accounts were by people who could not have seen the events and that these accounts closely followed (often word for word) well known earlier martyr literature.</ref> By the summer's end, more foreigners and as many as 2,000 Chinese Christians had been put to death in the province. Journalist and historical writer Nat Brandt has called the massacre of Christians in Shanxi "the greatest single tragedy in the history of Christian evangelicalism."<ref>Nat Brandt, ''[https://archive.org/details/massacreinshansi00bran <!-- quote="massacre in shansi". --> Massacre in Shansi]'', Syracuse University Press, p. xiii.</ref>

During the Boxer Rebellion as a whole, a total of 136 Protestant missionaries and 53 children were killed, and 47 Catholic priests and nuns, 30,000 Chinese Catholics, 2,000 Chinese Protestants, and 200 to 400 of the 700 Russian Orthodox Christians in Beijing were estimated to have been killed. Collectively, the Protestant dead were called the [[China Martyrs of 1900]].{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 184}} 222 of Russian Christian [[Chinese Martyrs]] including [[Metrophanes, Chi Sung|St. Metrophanes]] were [[canonization|locally canonised]] as [[New Martyrs]] on 22 April 1902, after [[Archimandrite]] Innocent (Fugurovsky), head of the Russian Orthodox Mission in China, solicited the [[Most Holy Synod]] to perpetuate their memory.

== Aftermath ==

=== Occupation, looting, and atrocities ===

[[File:Execution of a Boxer by the French, Teintsin.jpg|left|thumb|French troops execute a Boxer]]
Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities in northern China were occupied for more than one year by the international expeditionary force under the command of German General [[Alfred von Waldersee|Alfred Graf von Waldersee]]. Atrocities by foreign troops were common. French troops ravaged the countryside around Beijing on behalf of Chinese Catholics. The Americans and British paid General [[Yuan Shikai]] and his army (the [[New Army|Right Division]]) to help the Eight Nation Alliance suppress the Boxers. Yuan Shikai's forces killed tens of thousands of people in their anti Boxer campaign in [[Zhili Province]] and [[Shandong]] after the Alliance captured Beijing.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Warriors of the Rising Sun: A History of the Japanese Military|author=Edgerton, R.B.|date=1997|publisher=Norton|isbn=9780393040852|url=https://archive.org/details/warriorsofrising00edge|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/warriorsofrising00edge/page/94 94]|access-date=18 June 2017}}</ref> Yuan operated out of [[Baoding]] during the campaign, which ended in 1902.<ref name="google2">{{cite book|title=Yuan Shih-kʻai|author=Ch?ên, J.|date=1972|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804707893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_W-mAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA76|page=76|access-date=18 June 2017}}</ref> [[Li Hongzhang]] commanded Chinese soldiers to kill "Boxers" to assist the Alliance.<ref>Jan Kocvarp., [https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/bitstream/handle/11025/17656/Kocvar.pdf?sequence=1 Germany and the Boxer Uprising in China] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311030127/https://otik.uk.zcu.cz/bitstream/handle/11025/17656/Kocvar.pdf?sequence=1 |date=11 March 2016 }}  ''West Bohemian Historical Review'' Vol. 5.2 2015, p. 159</ref>

For contemporary British and American observers, German, Russian, and Japanese troops received the greatest criticism for their ruthlessness and willingness to wantonly execute Chinese of all ages and backgrounds, sometimes burning and killing entire village populations.<ref>Cohen, Paul A. ''History in Three Keys: The Boxers As Event, Experience, and Myth'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0231106505}} (1997), pp. 185-185</ref> The German force arrived too late to take part in the fighting, but undertook punitive expeditions to villages in the countryside. Kaiser Wilhelm II on 27 July during departure ceremonies for the German relief force included an impromptu, but intemperate reference to the [[Hun]] invaders of continental Europe which would later be resurrected by British propaganda to mock Germany during the First World War and Second World War:

{{cquote|Should you encounter the enemy, he will be defeated! No quarter will be given! Prisoners will not be taken! Whoever falls into your hands is forfeited.

One newspaper called the aftermath of the siege a "carnival of ancient loot", and others called it "an orgy of looting" by soldiers, civilians and missionaries. These characterisations called to mind the [[Old Summer Palace#Destruction|sacking of the Summer Palace in 1860]].<ref>James L.

An American diplomat, [[Herbert G. Squiers]], filled several railway carriages with loot and artifacts. The British Legation held loot auctions every afternoon and proclaimed, "Looting on the part of British troops was carried out in the most orderly manner." However, one British officer noted, "It is one of the unwritten [[laws of war]] that a city which does not surrender at the last and is taken by storm is looted." For the rest of 1900–1901, the British held loot auctions everyday except Sunday in front of the main-gate to the British Legation. Many foreigners, including [[Claude Maxwell MacDonald|Sir Claude Maxwell MacDonald]] and Lady Ethel MacDonald and [[George Ernest Morrison]] of ''[[The Times]]'', were active bidders among the crowd. Many of these looted items ended up in Europe.{{sfnb|Preston|2000|p = 284-285}} The Catholic [[Xishiku Cathedral|Beitang]] or North Cathedral was a "salesroom for stolen property."<ref>Chamberlin, Wilbur J. letter to his wife (11 December 1900), in [https://books.google.com/books?id=r4IdAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA191 ''Ordered to China: Letters of Wilbur J.

[[File:Execution of Boxers after the rebellion.png|right|thumb|Execution of Boxers by standing strangulation]]
Some but by no means all Western missionaries took an active part in calling for retribution. To provide restitution to missionaries and Chinese Christian families whose property had been destroyed, [[William Scott Ament|William Ament]], a missionary of [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]], guided American troops through villages to punish those he suspected of being Boxers and confiscate their property. When [[Mark Twain]] read of this expedition, he wrote a scathing essay, [[s:To the Person Sitting in Darkness|"To the Person Sitting in Darkness"]], that attacked the "Reverend bandits of the American Board," especially targeting Ament, one of the most respected missionaries in China.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 207-208 }} The controversy was front-page news during much of 1901.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' journalist E. J. Dillon stated that he witnessed the mutilated corpses of Chinese women who were raped and killed by the Alliance troops. The French commander dismissed the rapes, attributing them to "gallantry of the French soldier."

=== Reparations ===

After the capture of Peking by the foreign armies, some of Empress Dowager Cixi's advisers advocated that the war be carried on, arguing that China could have defeated the foreigners as it was disloyal and traitorous people within China who allowed Beijing and Tianjin to be captured by the Allies, and that the interior of China was impenetrable. They also recommended that Dong Fuxiang continue fighting. The Empress Dowager Cixi was practical, however, and decided that the terms were generous enough for her to acquiesce when she was assured of her continued reign after the war and that China would not be forced to cede any territory.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWxKQejMtlMC&pg=PA312|title=The Boxer Rebellion: The Dramatic Story of China's War on Foreigners that Shook the World in the Summer of 1900|author=Diana Preston|year=2000|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|page=312|isbn=0-8027-1361-0}}</ref>

On 7 September 1901, the Qing imperial court agreed to sign the "[[Boxer Protocol]]" also known as Peace Agreement between the Eight-Nation Alliance and China. The protocol ordered the execution of 10 high-ranking officials linked to the outbreak and other officials who were found guilty for the slaughter of foreigners in China. [[Alfons Mumm von Schwarzenstein|Alfons Mumm]] (Freiherr von Schwarzenstein), [[Ernest Satow]] and [[Komura Jutaro]] signed on behalf of Germany, Britain and Japan, respectively.

China was fined [[war reparations]] of 450,000,000 [[tael]]s of fine silver (≈{{convert|540000000|ozt|t}} @ 1.2&nbsp;ozt/tael) for the loss that it caused. The reparation was to be paid by 1940, within 39 years, and would be 982,238,150 taels with interest (4 percent per year) included. To help meet the payment it was agreed to increase the existing tariff from an actual 3.18 to 5 percent, and to tax hitherto duty-free merchandise. The sum of reparation was estimated by the Chinese population (roughly 450&nbsp;million in 1900), to let each Chinese pay one tael. Chinese custom income and salt tax were enlisted as guarantee of the reparation. China paid 668,661,220 taels of silver from 1901 to 1939, equivalent in 2010 to ≈US$61&nbsp;billion on a purchasing power parity basis.<ref name="Hsu, 481">Hsu, 481</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Ji Zhaojin|title=A History of Modern Shanghai Banking: The Rise and Decline of China's Financial Capitalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHKlDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA75|year=2016|publisher=Routledge|page=75|isbn=9781317478072}}</ref>

A large portion of the reparations paid to the United States was diverted to pay for the education of Chinese students in U.S. universities under the [[Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program]]. To prepare the students chosen for this program an institute was established to teach the English language and to serve as a preparatory school. When the first of these students returned to China they undertook the teaching of subsequent students; from this institute was born [[Tsinghua University]]. Some of the reparation due to Britain was later earmarked for a similar program{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}.

== Long-term consequences ==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2010}}
The European great powers finally ceased their ambitions of colonizing China since they had learned from the Boxer rebellions that the best way to deal with China was through the ruling dynasty, rather than directly with the Chinese people (a sentiment embodied in the adage: "The people are afraid of officials, the officials are afraid of foreigners, and the foreigners are afraid of the people") ({{zh|c=老百姓怕官，官怕洋鬼子，洋鬼子怕老百姓|labels=no}}), and they even briefly assisted the Qing in their war against the Japanese to prevent Japanese domination in the region.

Concurrently, the period marks the ceding of European great power interference in Chinese affairs, with the Japanese replacing the Europeans as the dominant power for their lopsided involvement in the war against the Boxers as well as their victory in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. With the toppling of the Qing that followed and the rise of the Nationalist [[Kuomintang]], European sway in China was reduced to symbolic status. After taking Manchuria in 1905, Japan came to dominate Asian affairs militarily and culturally with many of the Chinese scholars also educated in Japan, the most prominent example being [[Sun Yat-Sen]], who would later found the Nationalist [[Kuomintang]] in China.

In October 1900, Russia occupied the provinces of Manchuria,<ref name="Paine1996">{{cite book|first1=S. C.

Japan's clash with Russia over Liaodong and other provinces in eastern Manchuria, because of the Russian refusal to honour the terms of the Boxer protocol that called for their withdrawal, led to the [[Russo-Japanese War]] when two years of negotiations broke down in February 1904. The Russian Lease of the Liaodong (1898) was confirmed. Russia was ultimately defeated by an increasingly-confident Japan.

Besides the compensation, [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] reluctantly started some reforms, despite her previous views. Known as the [[New Policies]], which started in 1901, the [[imperial examination]] system for government service was eliminated, and the system of [[Chinese classic texts|education through Chinese classics]] was replaced with a [[liberal arts|European liberal system]] that led to a university degree. Along with the formation of new military and police organisations, the reforms also simplified central bureaucracy and made a start at revamping taxation policies.<ref name="Benedict1996">{{cite book|first1=Carol Ann|last1=Benedict|title=Bubonic Plague in Nineteenth-Century China|journal=Modern China|volume=14|issue=2|pages=107–55|url=https://archive.org/details/bubonicplagueinn00bene|url-access=registration|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2661-0|pmid=11620272|doi=10.1177/009770048801400201|s2cid=220733020}}</ref> After the deaths of Cixi and the [[Guangxu Emperor]] in 1908, the [[prince regent]] [[Zaifeng, Prince Chun|Zaifeng (Prince Chun)]], the Guangxu Emperor's brother, launched further reforms.

The effect on China was a weakening of the dynasty and its national defence capabilities. The government structure was temporarily sustained by the Europeans. Behind the international conflict, internal ideological differences between northern Chinese anti-foreign royalists and southern Chinese anti-Qing revolutionists were further deepened. The scenario in the last years of the Qing dynasty gradually escalated into a chaotic [[warlord era]] in which the most powerful northern warlords were hostile towards the southern revolutionaries, who overthrew the Qing monarchy in 1911. The rivalry was not fully resolved until the northern warlords were defeated by the Kuomintang's 1926–28 [[Northern Expedition]]. Prior to the final defeat of the Boxer Rebellion, all anti-Qing movements in the previous century, such as the [[Taiping Rebellion]], had been successfully suppressed by the Qing.

The historian [[Walter LaFeber]] has argued that President [[William McKinley]]'s decision to send 5,000 American troops to quell the rebellion marks "the origins of modern presidential war powers":<ref>[[Thomas Woods|Woods, Thomas]] (7 July 2005) [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/woods/woods45.html Presidential War Powers], [[LewRockwell.com]]</ref>

{{cquote|McKinley took a historic step in creating a new, 20th century presidential power.

It was now used, however, against recognised governments, and without obeying the [[War Powers Clause|Constitution's provisions about who was to declare war]].}}

== Controversies and changing views of the Boxers ==

From the beginning, views differed as to whether the Boxers were better seen as anti-imperialist, patriotic and [[proto-nationalist]], or as "uncivilized" irrational and futile opponents of inevitable change. The historian Joseph Esherick comments that "confusion about the Boxer Uprising is not simply a matter of popular misconceptions" since "there is no major incident in China's modern history on which the range of professional interpretation is as great".{{sfnb|Esherick|1987|p= xiv }}

Chinese liberals such as [[Hu Shih]] often condemned the Boxers for their irrationality and barbarity.<ref>顾则徐：清末民初思想领袖评价义和团总览</ref> [[Sun Yat-sen]], the founding father of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] and of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]], at first believed that the Boxer Movement had been stirred up by the Qing government's rumors, which "caused confusion among the populace" and delivered "scathing criticism" of the Boxers' "anti-foreignism and obscurantism". Sun praised the Boxers for their "spirit of resistance" but called them "bandits". Students shared an ambivalent attitude to the Boxers and stated that while the uprising originated from the "ignorant and stubborn people of the interior areas", their beliefs were "brave and righteous" and could "be transformed into a moving force for independence."<ref name="Han 20, 21">{{cite book|last=Han|first=Xiaorong |title=Chinese discourses on the peasant, 1900–1949 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oxTe1YYZa7MC&pg=PA20|date=February 2005|publisher= State University of New York Press|isbn=0791463192|pages=20, 21}}</ref> After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, nationalist Chinese became more sympathetic to the Boxers.

In other countries, views of the Boxers were complex and contentious. [[Mark Twain]] said that "the Boxer is a patriot. He loves his country better than he does the countries of other people.

Even some American churchmen spoke out in support of the Boxers. The evangelist Rev. Dr. [[George F. Pentecost]] said that the Boxer uprising was a

{{cquote|"patriotic movement to expel the 'foreign devils' – just that – the foreign devils". Suppose, he said, "the great nations of Europe were to put their fleets together, came over here, seize Portland, move on down to Boston, then New York, then Philadelphia, and so on down the Atlantic Coast and around the Gulf of Galveston? Suppose they took possession of these port cities, drove our people into the hinterland, built great warehouses and factories, brought in a body of dissolute agents, and calmly notified our people that henceforward they would manage the commerce of the country?

[[File:Boxer1900.jpg|upright|thumb|A Boxer during the revolt]]

The Russian newspaper ''Amurskii Krai'' criticized the killing of innocent civilians and charged that "restraint", "civilization" and "culture," instead of "racial hatred" and "destruction," would have been more becoming of a "civilized Christian nation." The paper asked, "What shall we tell civilized people? We shall have to say to them: 'Do not consider us as brothers anymore. We are mean and terrible people; we have killed those who hid at our place, who sought our protection.'"<ref name="LensenChʻen1982">{{cite book|author1=George Alexander Lensen|author2=Fang-chih Chʻen|title=The Russo-Chinese War |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ehhSAQAAIAAJ&q=midst+confidently+blemish+The+Russo-Chinese+War:+Chinese|year=1982|page=103}}</ref>

The events also left a longer impact. Historian Robert Bickers noted that for the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]], the Boxer Rebellion served as the "equivalent of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian 'mutiny']]", and the events of the rebellion influenced the idea of the [[Yellow Peril]] among the British public. Later events, he adds, such as the [[Northern Expedition|Chinese Nationalist Revolution]] in the 1920s and even the activities of the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] of the 1960s were perceived as being in the shadow of the Boxers.<ref>Robert Bickers, ''Britain in China: Community, Culture, and Colonialism, 1900–1949'' (Manchester; New York: Manchester University Press, distributed in the US by St. Martin's Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0719046971}}), p. 34</ref>

In [[Taiwan]] and [[Hong Kong]], history textbooks often present the Boxer as irrational, but in [[Mainland China]], the central government textbooks described the Boxer movement as an anti-imperialist, patriotic peasant movement that failed by the lack of leadership from the modern working class, and they described the international army as an invading force. In recent decades, however, large-scale projects of village interviews and explorations of archival sources have led historians in China to take a more nuanced view. Some non-Chinese scholars, such as Joseph Esherick, have seen the movement as anti-imperialist, but others hold that the concept "nationalistic" is [[anachronistic]] because the Chinese nation had not been formed, and the Boxers were more concerned with regional issues. Paul Cohen's recent study includes a survey of "the Boxers as myth," which shows how their memory was used in changing ways in 20th-century China from the [[New Culture Movement]] to the [[Cultural Revolution]].<ref>Pt Three, "The Boxers As Myth", Cohen, ''History in Three Keys'', pp. 211–288.</ref>

In recent years, the Boxer question has been debated in the People's Republic of China. In 1998, the critical scholar Wang Yi argued that the Boxers had features in common with the extremism of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Both events had the external goal of "liquidating all harmful pests" and the domestic goal of "eliminating bad elements of all descriptions" and that the relation was rooted in "cultural obscurantism." Wang explained to his readers the changes in attitudes towards the Boxers from the condemnation of the [[May Fourth Movement]] to the approval expressed by [[Mao Zedong]] during the Cultural Revolution.<ref>Wang Yi, "The Cultural Origins of the Boxer Movement's Obscurantism and Its Influence on the Cultural Revolution", in [[Douglas Kerr]], ed., ''Critical Zone Three''. (Hong Kong University Press), 155.</ref> In 2006, [[Yuan Weishi]], a professor of philosophy at [[Zhongshan University]] in Guangzhou, wrote that the Boxers by their "criminal actions brought unspeakable suffering to the nation and its people!

== Terminology ==

The first reports which came from China in 1898 referred to the village activists as the "Yihequan", (Wade–Giles: I Ho Ch'uan). The first known use of the term "Boxer" is contained in a letter which was written in Shandong in September 1899 by missionary Grace Newton. The context of the letter makes it clear that when it was written, "Boxer" was already a well-known term, it was possibly coined by [[Arthur Henderson Smith|Arthur H. Smith]] and Henry Porter, two missionaries who were also residing in Shandong.{{sfnp|Thompson|2009|p = 223}} Smith says in his 1902 book that the name

{{cquote|I Ho Ch'uan... literally denotes the 'Fists' (Ch'uan) of Righteousness (or Public) (I) Harmony (Ho), an apparent allusion to the strength of the united force which was to be put forth. Because the Chinese phrase 'fists and feet' signifies boxing and wrestling, there appeared to be no more suitable term for the adherents of the sect than 'Boxers,' a designation which was first used by one or two missionary correspondents of foreign journals in China, and later universally accepted on account of the difficulty of coining a better one.<ref>''China in Convulsion'' Vol I, pp. 154–55.</ref>}}

On 6 June 1900, ''The Times'' of London used the term "rebellion" in quotation marks, presumably to indicate its view that the rising was actually instigated by Empress Dowager Cixi.<ref>Jane Elliot, ''Some Did It for Civilisation''", p. 9, 1.</ref> The historian Lanxin Xiang refers to the uprising as the "so called 'Boxer Rebellion,'" and he also states that "while peasant rebellion was nothing new in [[History of China|Chinese history]], a war against the world's most powerful states was."<ref>Xiang, ''The Origins of the Boxer War'' pp. vii–viii.</ref> The name "Boxer Rebellion", concludes [[Joseph W. Esherick]], another contemporary historian, is truly a "misnomer", for the Boxers "never rebelled against the Manchu rulers of China and their Qing dynasty" and the "most common Boxer slogan, throughout the history of the movement, was "support the Qing, destroy the Foreigners." He adds that only after the movement was suppressed by the Allied Intervention did the foreign powers and influential Chinese officials both realize that the Qing royal family would have to remain as the government of China in order to maintain order and collect taxes in order to pay the indemnity. Therefore, in order to save their faces, the Empress Dowager and the members of the imperial court all argued that the Boxers were rebels and they also claimed that the only support which the Boxers received from the imperial court came from a few Manchu princes. Esherick concludes his argument by stating that the origin of the term "rebellion" was "purely political and opportunistic", but it has had a remarkable staying power, particularly in popular accounts.<ref>Esherick p. xiv. Esherick notes that many textbooks and secondary accounts followed Victor Purcell, ''The Boxer Uprising: A Background Study'' (1963) in seeing a shift from an early anti-dynastic movement to pro-dynastic, but that the "flood of publications" from Taiwan and the People's Republic (including both documents from the time and oral histories conducted in the 1950s) has shown this not to be the case. xv–xvi.</ref>

Other recent Western works refer to the uprising as the "Boxer Movement", the "Boxer War" or the Yihetuan Movement, while Chinese studies refer to it as the 义和团运动 (Yihetuan yundong), that is, the "Yihetuan Movement." In his discussion of the general and legal implications of the terminology which is involved, the German scholar Thoralf Klein notes that all of the terms, including the Chinese terms, are "posthumous interpretations of the conflict." He argues that each term, whether it be "uprising", "rebellion" or "movement" implies a different definition of the conflict. Even the term "Boxer War", which has frequently been used by contemporary scholars in the West, raises questions, because a war was never declared, and the Allied troops behaved like soldiers who were mounting a punitive expedition in colonial style, rather than soldiers who were waging a declared war with legal constraints. The Allies took advantage of the fact that China had not signed "The Laws and Customs of War on Land", a key document which was signed at the 1899 [[Hague Peace Conference]]. They argued that China had violated its provisions but they themselves ignored them. {{sfnb|Klein|2008}}

By 1900, many new forms of media had matured, including illustrated newspapers and magazines, postcards, broadsides and advertisements, all of which presented images of the Boxers and of the invading armies.<ref>Peter Perdue, "[http://video.mit.edu/watch/mit-visualizing-cultures-visualizing-the-boxer-uprising-10054/ Visualizing the Boxer Uprising]" MIT Visualizing Cultures Illustrated Slide Lecture</ref> The rebellion was covered in the foreign illustrated press by artists and photographers.

* In the Polish play ''[[The Wedding (1901 play)|The Wedding]]'' by [[Stanisław Wyspiański]], first published on 16 March 1901, even before the rebellion was finally crushed, the character of Czepiec asks the Journalist (''Dziennikarz'') one of the best-known questions in the history of Polish literature: ''"Cóż tam, panie, w polityce? Chińczyki trzymają się mocno!?'' (''"How are things in politics, Mister? Are the Chinese holding out firmly!?"'').<ref name="Wesele">{{cite web|author=met [2007-08-26] |url=http://broszka.pl/chincyki-trzymaja-sie-mocno, a |title=''Chińcyki trzymają się mocno!?'' |publisher=Broszka.pl |date=26 August 2007 |access-date=6 September 2012}}</ref>
* [[Liu E]], ''[[The Travels of Lao Can]]''<ref>translated by Harold Shaddick as ''The Travels of Lao Ts'an'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1952), also available in an abridged version which omits some scenes of the Boxers: ''The travels of Lao Can'', translated by Yang Xianyi, Gladys Yang (Beijing: Panda Books, 1983; 176p.),</ref> sympathetically shows an honest official trying to carry out reforms and depicts the Boxers as sectarian rebels.
* [[G. A. Henty]], ''With the Allies to Pekin, a Tale of the Relief of the Legations'' (New York: Scribners, 1903; London: Blackie, 1904). Juvenile fiction by a widely read author, depicts the Boxers as "a mob of ruffians."
* A false or forged diary, ''Diary of his Excellency Ching-Shan: Being a Chinese Account of the Boxer Troubles'', including text written by [[Sir Edmund Backhouse, 2nd Baronet|Edmund Backhouse]], who claimed he recovered the document from a burnt building. It is suspected that Backhouse falsified the document, as well as other stories, because he was prone to tell tales dubious in nature, including claims of nightly visits to the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].<ref>[[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]: ''A Hidden Life – The Enigma of Sir Edmund Backhouse'' (Published in the USA as ''Hermit of Peking, The Hidden Life of Sir Edmund Backhouse'') (1976)</ref>
* In [[Hergé]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' comic ''[[The Blue Lotus]]'', Tintin's Chinese friend [[Chang Chong-Chen]] when they first meet, after Tintin saves the boy from drowning, the boy asks Tintin why he saved him from drowning as, according to Chang's uncle who fought in the Rebellion, all white people were wicked.

* ''[[Tulku (novel)|Tulku]]'', a 1979 children's novel by [[Peter Dickinson]], includes the effects of the Boxer Rebellion on a remote part of China.
* ''[[The Diamond Age]] or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer'' (New York, 1996), by [[Neal Stephenson]], includes a quasi-historical re-telling of the Boxer Rebellion as an integral component of the novel
* The novel ''[[The Palace of Heavenly Pleasure]]'' (2003), by Adam Williams, describes the experiences of a small group of foreign missionaries, traders and railway engineers in a fictional town in northern China shortly before and during the Boxer Rebellion.
* Illusionist William Ellsworth Robinson (a.k.a. [[Chung Ling Soo]]) had a [[bullet catch|bullet-catch]] trick entitled "Condemned to Death by the Boxers", which famously resulted in his onstage death.
* The 1963 film ''[[55 Days at Peking]]'' directed by [[Nicholas Ray]] and starring [[Charlton Heston]], [[Ava Gardner]] and [[David Niven]].<ref name="days">{{IMDb title|id=0056800|title=55 Days at Peking}}</ref>
* In 1975 Hong Kong's [[Shaw Brothers]] studio produced the film ''Boxer Rebellion'' ({{zh|t=八國聯軍|p=bāguó liánjūn|w=Pa kuo lien chun|l=Eight-Nation Allied Army}}) under director [[Chang Cheh]] with one of the highest budgets to tell a sweeping story of disillusionment and revenge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hkflix.com/xq/asp/filmID.533288/qx/details.htm |title=HKflix |publisher=HKflix |access-date=6 September 2012}}</ref>

During the conflict, [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] kills his first slayer to impress [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]], and [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] decisively splits from [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]].
* The film ''[[Shanghai Knights]]'' (2003), starring [[Jackie Chan]] and [[Owen Wilson]], takes place in 1887 and features Boxers as the [[henchmen]] of the film's lead antagonist, English Lord Rathbone ([[Aiden Gillen]]), either working as [[mercenaries]] for Rathbone, or helping him as part of their support for the anti-imperialist leader Wu Chow ([[Donnie Yen]]), Rathbone's ally.
* ''[[The Last Empress (novel)|The Last Empress]]'' (Boston, 2007), by [[Anchee Min]], describes the long reign of the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] in which the siege of the legations is one of the climactic events in the novel.

* The pair of [[graphic novel]]s by [[Gene Luen Yang]], with colour by Lark Pien, ''[[Boxers and Saints]],'' describes the "bands of foreign missionaries and soldiers" who "roam the countryside bullying and robbing Chinese peasants." Little Bao, "harnessing the powers of ancient Chinese gods", recruits an army of Boxers, "commoners trained in [[kung fu]] who fight to free China from 'foreign devils.'"<ref>''Boxers and Saints'' (First Second Books, 2013 {{ISBN|1596439246}})[http://www.worldcat.org/title/boxers-saints-boxed-set/oclc/825754024&referer=brief_results WorldCat]</ref>
* The 2013 video game ''[[BioShock Infinite]]'' featured the Boxer Rebellion as a major historical moment for the floating city of Columbia. Columbia, in an effort to rescue American hostages during the rebellion, opened fire upon the city of Peking and burned it to the ground. These actions resulted in the United States recalling Columbia, which led to its secession from the Union.
* The Boxer Rebellion is the historical backdrop for the episode titled "Kung Fu Crabtree" (Season 7, Episode 16, aired 24 March 2014) of the television series ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]],'' in which Chinese officials visit Toronto in 1900 in search of Boxers who have fled from China.
