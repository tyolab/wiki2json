==Types of Cells==
Cells are of two types: [[eukaryotic]], which contain a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and [[prokaryotic|prokaryotic cells]], which do not have a nucleus, but a nucleoid region is still present. Prokaryotes are [[Unicellular organism|single-celled organisms]], while eukaryotes can be either single-celled or [[multicellular organism|multicellular]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Differences Between Prokaryotic Cell and Eukaryotic Cell @ BYJU'S|url=https://byjus.com/biology/prokaryotic-and-eukaryotic-cells/|access-date=2021-09-18|website=BYJUS|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Prokaryotic cells===
{{Main|Prokaryote}}
[[File:Prokaryote cell.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Structure of a typical [[prokaryotic]] cell]]

[[Prokaryote]]s include [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], two of the [[three domain system|three]] [[Domain (biology)|domains of life]]. Prokaryotic cells were the first form of [[life]] on Earth, characterized by having vital [[biological process]]es including [[cell signaling]]. They are simpler and smaller than eukaryotic cells, and lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s. The [[DNA]] of a prokaryotic cell consists of a single [[Circular prokaryote chromosome|circular chromosome]] that is in direct contact with the [[cytoplasm]]. The nuclear region in the cytoplasm is called the [[nucleoid]]. Most prokaryotes are the smallest of all organisms ranging from 0.5 to 2.0&nbsp;μm in diameter.<ref>''Microbiology : Principles and Explorations'' By Jacquelyn G. Black</ref>

A prokaryotic cell has three regions:
* Enclosing the cell is the [[cell envelope]] – generally consisting of a [[plasma membrane]] covered by a [[cell wall]] which, for some bacteria, may be further covered by a third layer called a [[bacterial capsule|capsule]]. Though most prokaryotes have both a cell membrane and a cell wall, there are exceptions such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]'' (bacteria) and ''[[Thermoplasma]]'' (archaea) which only possess the cell membrane layer. The envelope gives rigidity to the cell and separates the interior of the cell from its environment, serving as a protective filter. The cell wall consists of [[peptidoglycan]] in bacteria, and acts as an additional barrier against exterior forces. It also prevents the cell from expanding and bursting ([[cytolysis]]) from [[osmotic pressure]] due to a [[Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] environment. Some eukaryotic cells ([[plant cell]]s and [[fungus|fungal]] cells) also have a cell wall.
* Inside the cell is the [[cytoplasm|cytoplasmic region]] that contains the [[genome]] (DNA), ribosomes and various sorts of inclusions.<ref name="NCBI">{{NCBI-scienceprimer|article=What Is a Cell?|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503014839/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/About/primer/genetics_cell.html|access-date=3 May 2013}} 30 March 2004.</ref> The genetic material is freely found in the cytoplasm. Prokaryotes can carry [[extrachromosomal DNA]] elements called [[plasmid]]s, which are usually circular. Linear bacterial plasmids have been identified in several species of [[spirochete]] bacteria, including members of the genus ''[[Borrelia]]'' notably ''[[Borrelia burgdorferi]]'', which causes Lyme disease.<ref>European Bioinformatics Institute, [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/2can/genomes/bacteria/Borrelia_burgdorferi.html Karyn's Genomes: Borrelia burgdorferi], part of 2can on the EBI-EMBL database. Retrieved 5 August 2012</ref> Though not forming a nucleus, the [[DNA]] is condensed in a [[nucleoid]]. Plasmids encode additional genes, such as [[antibiotic resistance]] genes.
* On the outside, [[flagella]] and [[Pilus|pili]] project from the cell's surface. These are structures (not present in all prokaryotes) made of proteins that facilitate movement and communication between cells.

[[File:Plant cell structure-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Structure of a typical [[plant cell]]]]

===Eukaryotic cells===
{{Main|Eukaryote}}

[[Plants]], [[animals]], [[fungi]], [[slime mould]]s, [[protozoa]], and [[algae]] are all [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]]. These cells are about fifteen times wider than a typical prokaryote and can be as much as a thousand times greater in volume. The main distinguishing feature of eukaryotes as compared to prokaryotes is [[Cellular compartment|compartmentalization]]: the presence of membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (compartments) in which specific activities take place. Most important among these is a [[cell nucleus]],<ref name="NCBI"/> an organelle that houses the cell's [[DNA]]. This nucleus gives the eukaryote its name, which means "true kernel (nucleus)". Some of the other differences are:
* The plasma membrane resembles that of prokaryotes in function, with minor differences in the setup. Cell walls may or may not be present.
* The eukaryotic DNA is organized in one or more linear molecules, called [[chromosome]]s, which are associated with [[histone]] proteins. All chromosomal DNA is stored in the [[cell nucleus]], separated from the cytoplasm by a membrane.<ref name="NCBI"/> Some eukaryotic organelles such as [[mitochondria]] also contain some DNA.
* Many eukaryotic cells are [[cilium|ciliated]] with [[Cilium#Primary cilia|primary cilia]]. Primary cilia play important roles in chemosensation, [[mechanosensation]], and thermosensation. Each cilium may thus be "viewed as a sensory cellular [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] that coordinates a large number of cellular signaling pathways, sometimes coupling the signaling to ciliary motility or alternatively to cell division and differentiation."<ref name="Christenson2008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Satir P, Christensen ST | title = Structure and function of mammalian cilia | journal = Histochemistry and Cell Biology | volume = 129 | issue = 6 | pages = 687–93 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18365235 | pmc = 2386530 | doi = 10.1007/s00418-008-0416-9 | author3 = Søren T.

==Subcellular components==
All cells, whether [[prokaryotic]] or [[eukaryotic]], have a [[cell membrane|membrane]] that envelops the cell, regulates what moves in and out (selectively permeable), and maintains the [[Membrane potential|electric potential of the cell]]. Inside the membrane, the [[cytoplasm]] takes up most of the cell's volume. All cells (except [[red blood cell]]s which lack a cell nucleus and most organelles to accommodate maximum space for [[hemoglobin]]) possess [[DNA]], the hereditary material of [[gene]]s, and [[RNA]], containing the information necessary to [[gene expression|build]] various [[protein]]s such as [[enzyme]]s, the cell's primary machinery. There are also other kinds of [[biomolecule]]s in cells. This article lists these primary [[cellular component]]s, then briefly describes their function.

===Cell Membrane===
{{Main|Cell membrane}}
[[File: Cell membrane detailed diagram en.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Detailed diagram of lipid bilayer cell membrane]]
The [[cell membrane]], or plasma membrane, is a selectively permeable<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why is the plasma membrane called a selectively permeable membrane? - Biology Q&A|url=https://byjus.com/questions/why-is-the-plasma-membrane-called-a-selectively-permeable-membrane/|access-date=2021-09-18|website=BYJUS|language=en}}</ref> [[biological membrane]] that surrounds the cytoplasm of a cell. In animals, the plasma membrane is the outer boundary of the cell, while in plants and prokaryotes it is usually covered by a [[cell wall]]. This membrane serves to separate and protect a cell from its surrounding environment and is made mostly from a [[lipid bilayer|double layer of phospholipids]], which are [[amphiphilic]] (partly [[hydrophobic]] and partly [[hydrophilic]]). Hence, the layer is called a [[phospholipid bilayer]], or sometimes a fluid mosaic membrane. Embedded within this membrane is a macromolecular structure called the [[porosome]] the universal secretory portal in cells and a variety of [[protein]] molecules that act as channels and pumps that move different molecules into and out of the cell.<ref name="NCBI"/> The membrane is semi-permeable, and selectively permeable, in that it can either let a substance ([[molecule]] or [[ion]]) pass through freely, pass through to a limited extent or not pass through at all. Cell surface membranes also contain [[Receptor (biochemistry)#Transmembrane receptors|receptor]] proteins that allow cells to detect external signaling molecules such as [[hormone]]s.

===Cytoskeleton===
{{Main|Cytoskeleton}}
[[File:DAPIMitoTrackerRedAlexaFluor488BPAE.jpg|thumb|A fluorescent image of an endothelial cell. Nuclei are stained blue, [[mitochondria]] are stained red, and microfilaments are stained green.]]
The cytoskeleton acts to organize and maintain the cell's shape; anchors organelles in place; helps during [[endocytosis]], the uptake of external materials by a cell, and [[cytokinesis]], the separation of daughter cells after [[cell division]]; and moves parts of the cell in processes of growth and mobility. The eukaryotic cytoskeleton is composed of [[microtubule]]s, [[intermediate filament]]s and [[microfilament]]s. In the cytoskeleton of a [[neuron]] the intermediate filaments are known as [[neurofilament]]s. There are a great number of proteins associated with them, each controlling a cell's structure by directing, bundling, and aligning filaments.<ref name="NCBI"/> The prokaryotic cytoskeleton is less well-studied but is involved in the maintenance of cell shape, [[cell polarity|polarity]] and cytokinesis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Michie KA, Löwe J | title = Dynamic filaments of the bacterial cytoskeleton | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 75 | pages = 467–92 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16756499 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.75.103004.142452 | s2cid = 4550126 }}</ref> The subunit protein of microfilaments is a small, monomeric protein called [[actin]]. The subunit of microtubules is a dimeric molecule called [[tubulin]]. Intermediate filaments are heteropolymers whose subunits vary among the cell types in different tissues. But some of the subunit protein of intermediate filaments include [[vimentin]], [[desmin]], [[lamin]] (lamins A, B and C), [[keratin]] (multiple acidic and basic keratins), neurofilament proteins (NF–L, NF–M).

===Genetic material===
{{Main|DNA|RNA}}
[[File:DNA orbit animated.gif|thumb|[[DNA|Deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA)]]
Two different kinds of genetic material exist: [[DNA|deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) and [[RNA|ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). Cells use DNA for their long-term information storage. The biological information contained in an organism is [[Genetic code|encoded]] in its DNA sequence.<ref name="NCBI"/> RNA is used for information transport (e.g., [[mRNA]]) and [[enzyme|enzymatic]] functions (e.g., [[ribosome|ribosomal]] RNA). [[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) molecules are used to add amino acids during protein [[Translation (biology)|translation]].

Prokaryotic genetic material is organized in a simple [[circular bacterial chromosome]] in the [[nucleoid region]] of the cytoplasm. Eukaryotic genetic material is divided into different,<ref name="NCBI"/> linear molecules called [[chromosome]]s inside a discrete nucleus, usually with additional genetic material in some organelles like [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] (see [[endosymbiotic theory]]).

A [[human cell]] has genetic material contained in the [[cell nucleus]] (the [[genome|nuclear genome]]) and in the mitochondria (the [[mitochondrial genome]]). In humans the nuclear genome is divided into 46 linear DNA molecules called [[chromosome]]s, including 22 [[homologous chromosome]] pairs and a pair of [[sex chromosomes]]. The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule distinct from the nuclear DNA. Although the [[mitochondrial DNA]] is very small compared to nuclear chromosomes,<ref name="NCBI"/> it codes for 13 proteins involved in mitochondrial energy production and specific tRNAs.

Foreign genetic material (most commonly DNA) can also be artificially introduced into the cell by a process called [[transfection]]. This can be transient, if the DNA is not inserted into the cell's [[genome]], or stable, if it is. Certain [[virus]]es also insert their genetic material into the genome.

===Organelles===
{{Main|Organelle}}
Organelles are parts of the cell which are adapted and/or specialized for carrying out one or more vital functions, analogous to the [[Organ (biology)|organs]] of the human body (such as the heart, lung, and kidney, with each organ performing a different function).<ref name="NCBI"/> Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells have organelles, but prokaryotic organelles are generally simpler and are not membrane-bound.

There are several types of organelles in a cell. Some (such as the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[golgi apparatus]]) are typically solitary, while others (such as [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplasts]], [[peroxisomes]] and [[lysosomes]]) can be numerous (hundreds to thousands). The [[cytosol]] is the gelatinous fluid that fills the cell and surrounds the organelles.

====Eukaryotic====
[[File:HeLa cells stained with Hoechst 33258.jpg|thumb|Human cancer cells, specifically [[HeLa cells]], with DNA stained blue. The central and rightmost cell are in [[interphase]], so their DNA is diffuse and the entire nuclei are labelled. The cell on the left is going through [[mitosis]] and its chromosomes have condensed.]]
[[File:Blausen 0208 CellAnatomy.png|thumb|3D rendering of a eukaryotic cell]]
* '''Cell nucleus''': A cell's information center, the [[cell nucleus]] is the most conspicuous organelle found in a [[eukaryotic]] cell. It houses the cell's [[chromosomes]], and is the place where almost all [[DNA]] replication and [[RNA]] synthesis ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]) occur. The nucleus is spherical and separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane called the [[nuclear envelope]]. The nuclear envelope isolates and protects a cell's DNA from various molecules that could accidentally damage its structure or interfere with its processing. During processing, [[DNA]] is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]], or copied into a special [[RNA]], called [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA). This mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus, where it is translated into a specific protein molecule. The [[nucleolus]] is a specialized region within the nucleus where ribosome subunits are assembled. In prokaryotes, DNA processing takes place in the [[cytoplasm]].<ref name="NCBI"/>
* '''Mitochondria and chloroplasts''': generate energy for the cell. [[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are self-replicating organelles that occur in various numbers, shapes, and sizes in the cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells.<ref name="NCBI"/> [[Cellular respiration|Respiration]] occurs in the cell mitochondria, which generate the cell's energy by [[oxidative phosphorylation]], using [[oxygen]] to release energy stored in cellular nutrients (typically pertaining to [[glucose]]) to generate [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]. Mitochondria multiply by [[binary fission]], like prokaryotes. Chloroplasts can only be found in plants and algae, and they capture the sun's energy to make carbohydrates through [[photosynthesis]].

[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Diagram of the [[endomembrane system]]]]
* '''Endoplasmic reticulum''': The [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER) is a transport network for molecules targeted for certain modifications and specific destinations, as compared to molecules that float freely in the cytoplasm. The ER has two forms: the rough ER, which has ribosomes on its surface that secrete proteins into the ER, and the smooth ER, which lacks ribosomes.<ref name="NCBI"/> The smooth ER plays a role in calcium sequestration and release.
* '''Golgi apparatus''': The primary function of the Golgi apparatus is to process and package the [[macromolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s and [[lipid]]s that are synthesized by the cell.
* '''Lysosomes and peroxisomes''': [[Lysosome]]s contain [[digestive enzyme]]s (acid [[hydrolase]]s). They digest excess or worn-out [[organelle]]s, food particles, and engulfed [[virus]]es or [[bacteria]]. [[Peroxisome]]s have enzymes that rid the cell of toxic [[peroxide]]s. The cell could not house these destructive enzymes if they were not contained in a membrane-bound system.<ref name="NCBI"/>
* '''Centrosome''': the cytoskeleton organiser: The [[centrosome]] produces the [[microtubules]] of a cell – a key component of the [[cytoskeleton]]. It directs the transport through the [[endoplasmic reticulum|ER]] and the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Centrosomes are composed of two [[centrioles]], which separate during [[cell division]] and help in the formation of the [[mitotic spindle]]. A single centrosome is present in the [[animal cell]]s. They are also found in some fungi and algae cells.
* '''Vacuoles''': [[Vacuole]]s sequester waste products and in plant cells store water. They are often described as liquid filled space and are surrounded by a membrane. Some cells, most notably ''[[Amoeba (genus)|Amoeba]]'', have contractile vacuoles, which can pump water out of the cell if there is too much water. The vacuoles of plant cells and fungal cells are usually larger than those of animal cells.

====Eukaryotic and prokaryotic====
* '''Ribosomes''': The [[ribosome]] is a large complex of [[RNA]] and [[protein]] molecules.<ref name="NCBI"/> They each consist of two subunits, and act as an assembly line where RNA from the nucleus is used to synthesise proteins from amino acids. Ribosomes can be found either floating freely or bound to a membrane (the rough endoplasmatic reticulum in eukaryotes, or the cell membrane in prokaryotes).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ménétret JF, Schaletzky J, Clemons WM, Osborne AR, Skånland SS, Denison C, Gygi SP, Kirkpatrick DS, Park E, Ludtke SJ, Rapoport TA, Akey CW | display-authors = 6 | title = Ribosome binding of a single copy of the SecY complex: implications for protein translocation | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 1083–92 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18158904 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2007.10.034 | url = https://authors.library.caltech.edu/90566/2/1-s2.0-S1097276507008258-mmc1.pdf | doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Structures outside the cell membrane==
Many cells also have structures which exist wholly or partially outside the cell membrane. These structures are notable because they are not protected from the external environment by the [[semipermeable membrane|semipermeable cell membrane]]. In order to assemble these structures, their components must be carried across the cell membrane by export processes.

===Cell wall===
{{Further|Cell wall}}
Many types of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have a [[cell wall]]. The cell wall acts to protect the cell mechanically and chemically from its environment, and is an additional layer of protection to the cell membrane. Different types of cell have cell walls made up of different materials; plant cell walls are primarily made up of [[cellulose]], fungi cell walls are made up of [[chitin]] and bacteria cell walls are made up of [[peptidoglycan]].

===Prokaryotic===

====Capsule====
A gelatinous [[bacterial capsule|capsule]] is present in some bacteria outside the cell membrane and cell wall. The capsule may be [[polysaccharide]] as in [[pneumococci]], [[meningococci]] or [[polypeptide]] as ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]'' or [[hyaluronic acid]] as in [[streptococci]].

[[Flagella]] are organelles for cellular mobility. The bacterial flagellum stretches from cytoplasm through the cell membrane(s) and extrudes through the cell wall. They are long and thick thread-like appendages, protein in nature. A different type of flagellum is found in archaea and a different type is found in eukaryotes.

====Fimbriae====
A [[fimbria (bacteriology)|fimbria]] (plural fimbriae also known as a [[pilus]], plural pili) is a short, thin, hair-like filament found on the surface of bacteria. Fimbriae are formed of a protein called [[pilin]] ([[antigenic]]) and are responsible for the attachment of bacteria to specific receptors on human cells ([[cell adhesion]]). There are special types of pili involved in [[bacterial conjugation]].

==Cellular processes==
[[File:Three cell growth types.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Prokaryotes]] divide by [[binary fission]], while [[eukaryotes]] divide by [[mitosis]] or [[meiosis]].]]

===Replication===
{{Main|Cell division}}
Cell division involves a single cell (called a ''mother cell'') dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in [[multicellular organism]]s (the growth of [[biological tissue|tissue]]) and to procreation ([[vegetative reproduction]]) in [[unicellular organism]]s. [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells divide by [[binary fission]], while [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cells usually undergo a process of nuclear division, called [[mitosis]], followed by division of the cell, called [[cytokinesis]]. A [[diploid]] cell may also undergo [[meiosis]] to produce haploid cells, usually four. [[Haploid]] cells serve as [[gamete]]s in multicellular organisms, fusing to form new diploid cells.

[[DNA replication]], or the process of duplicating a cell's genome,<ref name="NCBI"/> always happens when a cell divides through mitosis or binary fission. This occurs during the S phase of the [[cell cycle]].

In meiosis, the DNA is replicated only once, while the cell divides twice. DNA replication only occurs before [[meiosis I]]. DNA replication does not occur when the cells divide the second time, in [[meiosis II]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Campbell Biology—Concepts and Connections|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Education|page=138}}</ref> Replication, like all cellular activities, requires specialized proteins for carrying out the job.<ref name="NCBI"/>
[[File:Catabolism schematic.svg|thumb|left|An outline of the [[catabolism]] of [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s and [[fat]]s]]

===DNA repair===
{{Main|DNA repair}}
In general, cells of all organisms contain enzyme systems that scan their DNA for [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|damages]] and carry out [[DNA repair|repair processes]] when damages are detected.<ref>D. Peter Snustad, Michael J. Simmons, Principles of Genetics – 5th Ed. (DNA repair mechanisms) pp. 364-368</ref> Diverse repair processes have evolved in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. The widespread prevalence of these repair processes indicates the importance of maintaining cellular DNA in an undamaged state in order to avoid cell death or errors of replication due to damages that could lead to [[mutation]]. [[Escherichia coli|''E. coli'']] bacteria are a well-studied example of a cellular organism with diverse well-defined [[DNA repair]] processes. These include: (1) [[nucleotide excision repair]], (2) [[DNA mismatch repair]], (3) [[non-homologous end joining]] of double-strand breaks, (4) [[homologous recombination|recombinational repair]] and (5) light-dependent repair ([[photolyase|photoreactivation]]).

===Growth and metabolism===
[[File:Proteinsynthesis.png|thumb|An overview of protein synthesis.<br />Within the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the cell (''light blue''), [[gene]]s (DNA, ''dark blue'') are [[transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] into [[RNA]]. This RNA is then subject to post-transcriptional modification and control, resulting in a mature [[mRNA]] (''red'') that is then transported out of the nucleus and into the [[cytoplasm]] (''peach''), where it undergoes [[translation (genetics)|translation]] into a protein. mRNA is translated by [[ribosome]]s (''purple'') that match the three-base [[codon]]s of the mRNA to the three-base anti-codons of the appropriate [[transfer RNA|tRNA]]. Newly synthesized proteins (''black'') are often further modified, such as by binding to an effector molecule (''orange''), to become fully active.]]
{{Main|Cell growth|Metabolism}}
Between successive cell divisions, cells grow through the functioning of cellular metabolism. Cell metabolism is the process by which individual cells process nutrient molecules. Metabolism has two distinct divisions: [[catabolism]], in which the cell breaks down complex molecules to produce energy and [[Reducing agent|reducing power]], and [[anabolism]], in which the cell uses energy and reducing power to construct complex molecules and perform other biological functions.
Complex sugars consumed by the organism can be broken down into simpler sugar molecules called [[monosaccharides]] such as [[glucose]]. Once inside the cell, glucose is broken down to make adenosine triphosphate ([[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]),<ref name="NCBI"/> a molecule that possesses readily available energy, through two different pathways.

===Protein synthesis===
{{Main|Protein biosynthesis}}
Cells are capable of synthesizing new proteins, which are essential for the modulation and maintenance of cellular activities. This process involves the formation of new protein molecules from [[amino acid]] building blocks based on information encoded in DNA/RNA. Protein synthesis generally consists of two major steps: [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Transcription is the process where genetic information in DNA is used to produce a complementary RNA strand. This RNA strand is then processed to give [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), which is free to migrate through the cell. mRNA molecules bind to protein-RNA complexes called [[ribosome]]s located in the [[cytosol]], where they are translated into polypeptide sequences. The ribosome mediates the formation of a polypeptide sequence based on the mRNA sequence. The mRNA sequence directly relates to the polypeptide sequence by binding to [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) adapter molecules in binding pockets within the ribosome. The new polypeptide then folds into a functional three-dimensional protein molecule.

===Motility===
{{Main|Motility}}
Unicellular organisms can move in order to find food or escape predators. Common mechanisms of motion include [[flagella]] and [[cilia]].

In multicellular organisms, cells can move during processes such as wound healing, the immune response and [[cancer metastasis]]. For example, in wound healing in animals, white blood cells move to the wound site to kill the microorganisms that cause infection. Cell motility involves many receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor and other proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ananthakrishnan R, Ehrlicher A | title = The forces behind cell movement | journal = International Journal of Biological Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 303–17 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17589565 | pmc = 1893118 | doi = 10.7150/ijbs.3.303 | publisher = Biolsci.org }}</ref> The process is divided into three steps – protrusion of the leading edge of the cell, adhesion of the leading edge and de-adhesion at the cell body and rear, and cytoskeletal contraction to pull the cell forward.

==Multicellularity==
{{main|Multicellular organism}}

===Cell specialization/differentiation===
{{Main|Cellular differentiation}}
[[File:C elegans stained.jpg|thumb|upright|Staining of a ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' which highlights the nuclei of its cells.]]
Multicellular organisms are [[organism]]s that consist of more than one cell, in contrast to [[single-celled organism]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last = Becker | first = Wayne M. | name-list-style = vanc | title = The world of the cell | publisher = [[Benjamin Cummings|Pearson Benjamin Cummings]] | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780321554185 | page = 480|display-authors=etal}}</ref>

In complex multicellular organisms, cells specialize into different [[cell type]]s that are adapted to particular functions. In mammals, major cell types include [[skin cells]], [[muscle cells]], [[neuron]]s, [[blood cell]]s, [[fibroblast]]s, [[stem cells]], and others. Cell types differ both in appearance and function, yet are [[Genetics|genetically]] identical. Cells are able to be of the same [[genotype]] but of different cell type due to the differential [[Regulation of gene expression|expression]] of the [[gene]]s they contain.

Most distinct cell types arise from a single [[totipotent]] cell, called a [[zygote]], that [[Cellular differentiation|differentiates]] into hundreds of different cell types during the course of [[Development (biology)|development]]. Differentiation of cells is driven by different environmental cues (such as cell–cell interaction) and intrinsic differences (such as those caused by the uneven distribution of [[molecule]]s during [[cell division|division]]).

{{Main|Evolutionary history of life}}
The origin of cells has to do with the [[Abiogenesis|origin of life]], which began the [[timeline of evolution|history of life]] on Earth.

===Origin of the first cell===
[[File:Stromatolites.jpg|thumb|[[Stromatolites]] are left behind by [[cyanobacteria]], also called blue-green algae. They are the oldest known fossils of life on Earth. This one-billion-year-old fossil is from [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in the United States.]]
{{further|Abiogenesis|Evolution of cells}}

There are several theories about the origin of small molecules that led to life on the [[early Earth]]. They may have been carried to Earth on meteorites (see [[Murchison meteorite]]), created at [[Hydrothermal vent|deep-sea vents]], or synthesized by lightning in a reducing atmosphere (see [[Miller–Urey experiment]]). There is little experimental data defining what the first self-replicating forms were. [[RNA]] is thought to be the earliest self-replicating molecule, as it is capable of both storing genetic information and catalyzing chemical reactions (see [[RNA world hypothesis]]), but some other entity with the potential to self-replicate could have preceded RNA, such as [[Abiogenesis#Clay hypothesis|clay]] or [[peptide nucleic acid]].<ref name=OrgelLE>{{cite journal | vauthors = Orgel LE | title = The origin of life--a review of facts and speculations | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 23 | issue = 12 | pages = 491–5 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9868373 | doi = 10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01300-0 }}</ref>

===Origin of eukaryotic cells===
{{further|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
The eukaryotic cell seems to have evolved from a [[symbiosis|symbiotic community]] of prokaryotic cells. DNA-bearing organelles like the [[mitochondria]] and the [[chloroplasts]] are descended from ancient symbiotic oxygen-breathing [[proteobacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]], respectively, which were [[Endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosed]] by an ancestral [[archaea]]n prokaryote.

There is still considerable debate about whether organelles like the [[hydrogenosome]] predated the origin of [[mitochondria]], or vice versa: see the [[hydrogen hypothesis]] for the origin of eukaryotic cells.

[[File:RobertHookeMicrographia1665.jpg|thumb|Robert Hooke's drawing of cells in [[Cork (material)|cork]], 1665]]
* 1632–1723: [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] taught himself to make [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], constructed basic [[optical microscope]]s and drew protozoa, such as ''[[Vorticella]]'' from rain water, and [[Bacterium|bacteria]] from his own mouth.
* 1665: [[Robert Hooke]] discovered cells in [[Cork (material)|cork]], then in living plant tissue using an early compound microscope. He coined the term ''cell'' (from [[Latin]] ''cellula'', meaning "small room"<ref name="npr1"/>) in his book ''[[Micrographia]]'' (1665).<ref name="Hooke">{{cite book|last1=Hooke|first1=Robert | name-list-style = vanc |title=Micrographia: ...|date=1665|publisher=Royal Society of London|location=London, England|pages=113|url= https://archive.org/stream/mobot31753000817897#page/113/mode/2up}}" ...

" – Hooke describing his observations on a thin slice of cork. See also:
 [http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/hooke.html Robert Hooke]</ref>
* 1839: [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] elucidated the principle that plants and animals are made of cells, concluding that cells are a common unit of structure and development, and thus founding the cell theory.
* 1855: [[Rudolf Virchow]] stated that new cells come from pre-existing cells by [[cell division]] (''omnis cellula ex cellula'').
* 1859: The belief that life forms can occur spontaneously (''[[Abiogenesis|generatio spontanea]]'') was contradicted by [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) (although [[Francesco Redi]] had performed an experiment in 1668 that suggested the same conclusion).
* 1931: [[Ernst Ruska]] built the first [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM) at the [[University of Berlin]]. By 1935, he had built an EM with twice the resolution of a light microscope, revealing previously unresolvable organelles.
* 1953: Based on [[Rosalind Franklin]]'s work, [[James D. Watson|Watson]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]] made their first announcement on the [[double helix]] structure of DNA.
* 1981: [[Lynn Margulis]] published ''Symbiosis in Cell Evolution'' detailing the [[endosymbiotic theory]].
